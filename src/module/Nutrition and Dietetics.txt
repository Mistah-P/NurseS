A nurse assigned to the medical ward performs a nutritional assessment on a postoperative patient who shows signs of delayed wound healing. She uses the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) tool to evaluate the patient’s weight history, dietary intake, and functional capacity. Laboratory values reveal low serum albumin and hemoglobin levels, indicating protein–energy malnutrition. The nurse collaborates with the dietitian to develop a high-protein, high-calorie diet plan that includes lean meat, eggs, and legumes. She monitors daily intake and encourages small frequent meals to increase appetite. The nurse documents progress and reassesses nutritional status weekly. By integrating assessment, collaboration, and health education, the nurse ensures optimal nutrition that promotes tissue repair and recovery.
A community health nurse organizes a feeding program for undernourished children in a rural barangay. She measures height-for-age and weight-for-age using the WHO growth chart to determine malnutrition prevalence. The nurse prepares a menu that includes nutrient-dense local foods such as mung beans, fish, and vegetables rich in vitamins A and C. She educates parents about balanced diets, food safety, and the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months. Follow-up visits are conducted to monitor the children’s progress and reinforce dietary counseling. This scenario demonstrates the nurse’s role in nutrition surveillance, education, and community empowerment, preventing long-term developmental deficits related to malnutrition.
A nurse caring for a diabetic patient applies principles of therapeutic nutrition. She collaborates with the physician and dietitian to design a carbohydrate-controlled diet, focusing on complex carbohydrates, fiber-rich foods, and limited saturated fat. The nurse educates the patient on glycemic index, portion control, and the importance of regular meal timing. Blood glucose levels are monitored before and after meals, and the nurse evaluates the patient’s response to dietary modifications. She teaches self-monitoring and encourages lifestyle changes, such as regular physical activity and avoiding refined sugars. By integrating nutrition education with clinical care, the nurse supports metabolic control and prevents complications such as neuropathy and cardiovascular disease.
In a cardiac unit, the nurse provides dietary counseling to a patient diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She emphasizes adherence to the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. The nurse instructs the patient to reduce sodium intake, avoid processed foods, and replace saturated fats with healthy oils like olive oil. She monitors blood pressure, lipid profile, and weight to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary interventions. By using motivational interviewing, the nurse helps the patient set achievable goals, such as limiting salt to 2 grams per day. This approach demonstrates the nurse’s role in preventive cardiology through dietary modification and lifestyle education.
A nurse working in the oncology unit assesses the nutritional needs of a patient undergoing chemotherapy who complains of anorexia and taste alteration. The nurse collaborates with the dietitian to implement small, frequent, high-calorie meals and oral nutritional supplements. She recommends cold or bland foods to minimize nausea and metallic taste. Hydration is encouraged to prevent dehydration due to vomiting or diarrhea. The nurse uses nutritional counseling and behavior modification to improve intake despite treatment side effects. Regular weight monitoring and biochemical assessments are performed to track progress. Through empathy and evidence-based practice, the nurse promotes nutritional support that enhances treatment tolerance and quality of life for cancer patients.
In a geriatric facility, the nurse monitors elderly clients for signs of malnutrition and dehydration, common due to diminished appetite and swallowing difficulties. She assesses Body Mass Index (BMI), skin turgor, and mucous membrane moisture. The nurse provides modified texture diets and thickened fluids for those with dysphagia to prevent aspiration. She encourages high-fiber foods to manage constipation and ensures adequate calcium and vitamin D intake to prevent osteoporosis. Education on proper hydration and portion sizes is given to caregivers. By providing individualized nutritional care, the nurse supports the physiological and psychosocial needs of older adults, enhancing comfort and promoting functional independence.
A nurse in the maternity ward teaches a postpartum mother about nutritional requirements during lactation. She explains the need for an additional 500 kcal/day and encourages the intake of protein-rich foods, green leafy vegetables, and adequate fluids to maintain milk production. The nurse emphasizes the avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods that may affect breast milk composition. She conducts a 24-hour dietary recall and provides a meal plan tailored to cultural preferences. Education focuses on iron-rich and calcium-containing foods to replenish maternal nutrient stores. This demonstrates the nurse’s role in maternal nutrition counseling, ensuring both mother and infant receive optimal nourishment.
In a surgical ward, a nurse manages the diet of a patient recovering from a total gastrectomy. She initiates enteral feeding through a nasojejunal tube, monitoring for tolerance and signs of aspiration. The nurse ensures the feeding solution provides balanced macronutrients and adequate electrolyte concentration. Gradual progression to soft, small meals is made as tolerated. She observes for symptoms of dumping syndrome, such as dizziness and diarrhea, and educates the patient on eating slowly and avoiding sugary foods. The nurse records intake and output meticulously to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. This case highlights the importance of clinical nutrition management in postoperative recovery and gastrointestinal surgery.
In a pediatric ward, the nurse provides dietary care for a child with celiac disease. She educates the parents about maintaining a gluten-free diet, avoiding wheat, barley, and rye. The nurse checks food labels carefully and recommends alternative grains such as rice and corn. She monitors the child’s growth parameters and stool consistency to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary therapy. The nurse also collaborates with the dietitian to ensure the child receives adequate iron, folate, and vitamin B12 supplementation. Through consistent education and monitoring, the nurse prevents complications like malabsorption and supports normal growth and development. This scenario underscores the critical role of nurses in managing special diets for pediatric patients.
A nurse in an intensive care unit implements total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for a critically ill patient unable to tolerate enteral feeding. She checks the central venous catheter site for signs of infection, verifies solution composition, and ensures correct infusion rate using an infusion pump. Blood glucose and electrolyte levels are monitored to detect complications such as hyperglycemia or hypophosphatemia. The nurse maintains strict aseptic technique during TPN preparation and administration. She gradually transitions the patient to enteral or oral feeding once bowel function returns. This scenario demonstrates the nurse’s advanced clinical role in nutritional support therapy, ensuring safety, precision, and metabolic stability in critically ill patients.
