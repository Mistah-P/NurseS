The nurse begins her shift by performing hand hygiene using the five moments of handwashing as recommended by the World Health Organization. She ensures proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) — gloves, mask, and gown — before entering the patient’s room. Applying the principles of medical asepsis, she prevents cross-contamination while preparing to administer oral medication. The nurse verifies the five rights of medication administration: right patient, right drug, right dose, right route, and right time. She maintains patient safety by double-checking the medication label against the physician’s order. This adherence to standard precautions reflects the foundation of nursing practice — ensuring infection control, patient safety, and ethical accountability. Every action demonstrates competence and the nurse’s commitment to the core of professional care: do no harm and maintain integrity in all nursing interventions.
A nurse in a medical-surgical ward uses the nursing process as her systematic framework in providing holistic care. During assessment, she gathers both subjective and objective data, listens to the patient’s concerns, and observes physical signs. She formulates nursing diagnoses using NANDA-I taxonomy such as “Impaired physical mobility related to surgical incision.” She then sets measurable short-term and long-term goals under the planning phase. Implementation includes wound care and ambulation assistance, while evaluation focuses on the patient’s progress toward mobility improvement. This structured process emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and clinical judgment, forming the backbone of nursing fundamentals. The scenario demonstrates how the ADPIE framework (Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Implementation, Evaluation) guides nurses in providing individualized, evidence-based care for every patient.
The nurse performs therapeutic communication when dealing with an anxious preoperative patient. She maintains eye contact, uses active listening, and employs open-ended questions to explore the patient’s fears. Techniques like clarification, reflection, and restating help ensure understanding and empathy. The nurse avoids false reassurance, instead focusing on promoting comfort and trust. She uses nonverbal cues such as nodding and appropriate touch to convey presence and support. This scenario highlights how communication is not just verbal — it’s the foundation of establishing rapport and delivering person-centered care. By integrating empathy, respect, and professionalism, the nurse builds a therapeutic relationship that reduces anxiety and enhances the patient’s emotional well-being prior to surgery.
During bed bath procedures for a bedridden patient, the nurse applies basic comfort measures and infection control principles. She gathers supplies, explains the procedure, and provides privacy by closing the curtains. Using principles of body mechanics, she prevents strain by bending her knees and maintaining a straight back while turning the patient. She observes the skin for redness or pressure injuries, especially on bony prominences, and applies lotion to maintain skin integrity. The nurse ensures the water temperature is safe and monitors the patient’s response throughout. This procedure demonstrates fundamental nursing skills — providing hygiene, comfort, safety, and dignity. Beyond physical care, it reflects compassion and attention to the patient’s holistic needs, reinforcing that the essence of nursing lies in both technical skill and human touch.
A nurse on the night shift monitors a postoperative patient connected to intravenous fluids. She checks for patency, assesses the insertion site for signs of phlebitis or infiltration, and regulates the flow rate according to the physician’s order. She documents intake and output accurately to maintain fluid balance. Before changing the IV bag, she performs aseptic technique, ensuring sterility is not compromised. This scenario reflects the nurse’s role in maintaining physiological stability through basic nursing procedures. She observes for adverse reactions and communicates promptly with the physician if abnormalities arise. Through meticulous observation, accurate documentation, and adherence to standard protocols, the nurse demonstrates accountability and safety — essential components in the fundamentals of nursing care.
In a long-term care facility, the nurse assists an elderly patient in ambulating with the use of a gait belt and walker. She performs a safety check by ensuring non-slip footwear and clearing the walking path of obstacles. Applying ergonomic principles and fall prevention strategies, she provides steady support without taking over the patient’s effort. The nurse encourages the patient’s independence while maintaining safety — reinforcing the principle of self-care and patient autonomy as promoted by Dorothea Orem’s theory. She assesses for dizziness or weakness during ambulation and records findings accurately. This daily routine illustrates that even simple actions like assisting in mobility are grounded in professional standards, safety awareness, and the promotion of independence, which are integral to the fundamentals of nursing practice.
A nurse in a rehabilitation ward practices documentation and legal accountability by recording every nursing intervention in the patient’s chart immediately after completion. She uses clear, factual, and concise language following the SOAPIE format — Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, Intervention, and Evaluation. The nurse avoids erasures and ensures all entries are time-stamped and signed. When receiving verbal orders, she repeats them back to confirm accuracy. Proper documentation not only ensures continuity of care but also serves as a legal record of nursing actions. This attention to detail upholds the ethical and legal standards of nursing, demonstrating that accurate record-keeping is as vital as bedside care. It ensures transparency, promotes accountability, and protects both the patient and the nurse.
The nurse performs vital signs monitoring on a patient admitted with pneumonia. She measures temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure, noting an increased respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation. She immediately reports these findings to the physician and applies oxygen therapy as ordered. The nurse re-evaluates after intervention and documents all results. Understanding homeostasis and pathophysiological changes allows her to interpret the data accurately. She uses a systematic approach to detect early deterioration, demonstrating clinical competence and vigilance. This practice shows how foundational skills like vital sign monitoring are crucial for early detection of complications, serving as the first step in preventing critical events and maintaining physiological stability.
In a surgical ward, the nurse applies infection control and environmental safety principles. She ensures that all equipment is disinfected, sharps are disposed of in puncture-proof containers, and waste segregation follows color-coded guidelines. She conducts routine environmental checks to ensure that the ward meets safety standards for both patients and staff. During wound dressing, she uses sterile gloves, maintains a sterile field, and follows the principles of surgical asepsis. By applying infection prevention and control measures, she protects vulnerable patients from hospital-acquired infections. This fundamental aspect of nursing demonstrates the continuous commitment to creating a safe and therapeutic environment conducive to healing.
Before discharge, the nurse provides patient education on medication management, diet, and follow-up appointments. She uses the teach-back method to ensure the patient understands instructions. By integrating health promotion and disease prevention into care, she fulfills her role as an educator and advocate. She encourages the patient to report any side effects and adhere to prescribed treatment. This demonstrates how the fundamentals of nursing go beyond bedside procedures — encompassing health teaching, advocacy, and continuity of care. Through clear communication and patient-centered teaching, the nurse empowers individuals to take responsibility for their own health, reinforcing the holistic nature of nursing practice that integrates physical, emotional, and educational dimensions.
