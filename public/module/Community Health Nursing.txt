During admission, a nurse establishes rapport with a patient who appears withdrawn and anxious. She introduces herself, explains her role, and listens attentively to the patient’s concerns. As care continues, the relationship progresses through Peplau’s phases — orientation, working, and resolution. The nurse’s therapeutic communication builds trust and encourages the patient to participate actively in the care process. Peplau’s theory emphasizes the significance of nurse–patient interaction as a core element of nursing practice.

A nurse caring for a patient with diabetes uses Sister Callista Roy’s Adaptation Model to assess how the patient adapts to lifestyle changes. She evaluates physiological, psychological, and social responses to insulin therapy and diet modification. The nurse assists in creating a routine that supports medication adherence and stress reduction. When the patient demonstrates improved glucose control and positive coping, the nurse evaluates this as successful adaptation. Roy’s model reminds nurses that health involves continuous adaptation to internal and external stressors.




A terminally ill patient expresses fear of dying alone. The nurse sits quietly beside the patient, offering emotional presence and empathy. She holds the patient’s hand and listens without judgment.

The nurse’s sincere presence brings peace to the patient, showing that caring is the essence of nursing beyond physical interventions.

A nurse caring for a patient recovering from stroke observes that family conflict and financial stress are affecting the patient’s rehabilitation. She applies Betty Neuman’s Systems Model, identifying intrapersonal, interpersonal, and extrapersonal stressors. The nurse collaborates with a social worker and encourages family counseling.

This approach reinforces the nurse’s role in maintaining system stability amid stress.

The nurse assists a patient recovering from pneumonia who struggles with daily self-care activities. Guided by Virginia Henderson’s definition of nursing, she supports the patient in performing tasks they cannot yet do independently.

Henderson’s concept emphasizes that nursing aims to help individuals gain independence as quickly as possible.

The model highlights that expertise develops gradually through experience and reflective practice.
