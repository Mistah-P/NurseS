1.
During admission, a nurse establishes rapport with a patient who appears withdrawn and anxious. She introduces herself, explains her role, and listens attentively to the patient’s concerns. As care continues, the relationship progresses through Peplau’s phases — orientation, working, and resolution.

2.
The nurse’s therapeutic communication builds trust and encourages the patient to participate actively in the care process. Peplau’s theory emphasizes the significance of nurse–patient interaction as a core element of nursing practice. A nurse caring for a patient with diabetes uses Sister Callista Roy’s Adaptation Model to assess how the patient adapts to lifestyle changes.

3.
She evaluates physiological, psychological, and social responses to insulin therapy and diet modification. The nurse assists in creating a routine that supports medication adherence and stress reduction. When the patient demonstrates improved glucose control and positive coping, the nurse evaluates this as successful adaptation.

4.
Roy’s model reminds nurses that health involves continuous adaptation to internal and external stressors. A terminally ill patient expresses fear of dying alone. The nurse sits quietly beside the patient, offering emotional presence and empathy.

5.
She holds the patient’s hand and listens without judgment. Through caring moments, she demonstrates Jean Watson’s Theory of Human Caring, which values compassion, dignity, and transpersonal connection. The nurse’s sincere presence brings peace to the patient, showing that caring is the essence of nursing beyond physical interventions.

6.
A nurse caring for a patient recovering from stroke observes that family conflict and financial stress are affecting the patient’s rehabilitation. She applies Betty Neuman’s Systems Model, identifying intrapersonal, interpersonal, and extrapersonal stressors. The nurse collaborates with a social worker and encourages family counseling.

7.
By addressing stress holistically, she strengthens the patient’s line of defense, supporting both physical and emotional recovery. This approach reinforces the nurse’s role in maintaining system stability amid stress. The nurse assists a patient recovering from pneumonia who struggles with daily self-care activities.

8.
Guided by Virginia Henderson’s definition of nursing, she supports the patient in performing tasks they cannot yet do independently. The nurse focuses on maintaining comfort, proper nutrition, and rest. Gradually, the patient regains strength and can perform self-care without assistance.

9.
Henderson’s concept emphasizes that nursing aims to help individuals gain independence as quickly as possible. A nurse leads a wellness campaign in the workplace, encouraging employees to adopt healthy lifestyles. She applies Nola Pender’s Health Promotion Model, focusing on personal motivation, perceived benefits, and barriers to health behaviors.

10.
The nurse educates the group about physical activity, stress management, and proper nutrition. Participants set achievable goals like walking thirty minutes daily. By promoting proactive health behaviors, the nurse supports long-term well-being and disease prevention.

11.
In a multicultural hospital, a nurse cares for a patient from a different cultural background who prefers herbal remedies alongside prescribed medications. The nurse applies Madeleine Leininger’s Transcultural Nursing Theory by respecting the patient’s beliefs and integrating culturally appropriate care. She communicates openly and ensures mutual understanding between the patient and healthcare team.

12.
Recognizing and valuing cultural diversity strengthens trust and ensures holistic, patient-centered care. A senior nurse mentors a newly hired graduate nurse in the intensive care unit. She explains complex procedures, encourages critical thinking, and supervises medication administration.

13.
Over time, the novice nurse transitions from relying on rules to making independent clinical judgments. This reflects Patricia Benner’s Novice to Expert Model, which outlines professional growth through experiential learning. The model highlights that expertise develops gradually through experience and reflective practice.

14.
A community health nurse visits a rural home where a pregnant mother is in her third trimester. She conducts blood pressure monitoring, educates about balanced nutrition, and checks the baby’s growth progress. The nurse also provides iron and folic acid supplements.

15.
Following maternal care protocols, she advises on proper prenatal check-ups and prepares the family for safe delivery. Her intervention strengthens maternal and child health outcomes in underserved areas. The nurse coordinates with the barangay officials for a routine immunization day.

16.
She ensures that all children under five receive the required vaccines such as BCG, DPT, OPV, and measles. Using proper cold chain management, she keeps vaccines effective and educates mothers about the importance of immunization schedules. By maintaining herd immunity, the nurse prevents outbreaks of preventable diseases in the community.

17.
After reports of dengue cases in the area, the nurse organizes a health education session for residents. She demonstrates how to eliminate mosquito breeding sites, encourages the use of mosquito nets, and promotes community clean-up drives. By applying principles of environmental sanitation and preventive health, she empowers the community to take collective action against vector-borne diseases.
