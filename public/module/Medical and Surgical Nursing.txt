A nurse prepares a postoperative patient for early ambulation after an abdominal surgery. She checks the physician’s order, assesses the patient’s vital signs, and ensures that the intravenous line is secured. Before assisting, she explains the purpose of ambulation — to prevent deep vein thrombosis, atelectasis, and constipation. The nurse supports the patient while walking, monitoring for dizziness or hypotension. Afterward, she records the distance ambulated and evaluates tolerance. This demonstrates the nurse’s critical role in promoting postoperative recovery, preventing complications, and reinforcing evidence-based practice in surgical nursing care.
In the medical ward, a nurse monitors a patient with congestive heart failure who is on furosemide therapy. She measures intake and output, checks for edema, and monitors serum potassium levels to detect potential hypokalemia. The nurse provides dietary teaching on potassium-rich foods and observes for signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes and low urine output. Her interventions aim to maintain fluid balance and optimize cardiac output. This highlights the nurse’s vital role in clinical assessment and therapeutic monitoring for cardiac patients.
A nurse caring for a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) performs regular respiratory assessments. She observes the use of accessory muscles, auscultates lung sounds for wheezing or crackles, and checks oxygen saturation using a pulse oximeter. The nurse administers prescribed bronchodilators via nebulization, encourages pursed-lip breathing, and positions the patient in a high Fowler’s position to promote lung expansion. She also teaches energy conservation techniques and monitors response to therapy. This scenario reflects the nurse’s role in airway management, oxygen therapy, and patient education to improve gas exchange and prevent respiratory distress.
A nurse assists in the care of a patient with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who presents with poor wound healing. She assesses the wound for color, drainage, odor, and size, using aseptic technique during dressing changes. Blood glucose monitoring is performed before meals and at bedtime, and the nurse educates the patient on glycemic control and foot care. She collaborates with the physician and nutritionist for a comprehensive care plan that includes dietary modification and medication adherence. The nurse’s holistic approach promotes tissue perfusion and prevents complications such as diabetic neuropathy and infection.
During a shift in the surgical ward, the nurse prepares a patient for appendectomy. She ensures informed consent is signed, checks for allergies, and confirms that the patient has been fasting for at least eight hours. Preoperative teaching includes deep breathing, coughing exercises, and postoperative pain management using the numeric pain scale. After surgery, she monitors for signs of infection such as fever or purulent drainage, and records vital signs every four hours. This demonstrates the nurse’s competence in perioperative care — ensuring patient safety before, during, and after surgical procedures.
A nurse manages a patient with hypertension admitted for uncontrolled blood pressure. She assesses lifestyle factors such as diet, stress, and physical activity. Antihypertensive medications are administered as prescribed, and the nurse regularly monitors blood pressure trends, checks for orthostatic hypotension, and evaluates medication side effects like dizziness or fatigue. She provides health education on low-sodium diets, medication adherence, and avoiding smoking or alcohol. Through consistent monitoring and teaching, the nurse promotes long-term blood pressure control and cardiovascular health.
In the postoperative unit, a nurse observes a patient who suddenly becomes pale and diaphoretic. Vital signs reveal a rapid pulse and low blood pressure. Suspecting hypovolemic shock, the nurse calls for assistance, places the patient in a supine position with elevated legs, and starts oxygen therapy. She checks surgical dressings for active bleeding and ensures that IV fluids are running as ordered. The physician is notified immediately, and emergency protocols are initiated. This shows the nurse’s ability to recognize early signs of deterioration, apply critical thinking, and perform prompt life-saving interventions.
A nurse attends to a patient with pneumonia complaining of shortness of breath. She assesses respiratory effort, checks oxygen saturation, and listens for crackles or rhonchi. The nurse assists with chest physiotherapy, administers prescribed antibiotics, and encourages fluid intake to thin secretions. She also instructs the patient to perform incentive spirometry to improve lung expansion. By documenting lung sound changes and patient response, the nurse ensures continuity of care. This scenario highlights the integration of assessment, intervention, and evaluation, the core of medical-surgical nursing practice.
In the renal ward, the nurse cares for a patient undergoing hemodialysis. Before treatment, she assesses the arteriovenous fistula for a thrill and bruit, checks vital signs, and verifies lab results, particularly serum creatinine and electrolytes. During dialysis, she observes for complications such as hypotension, muscle cramps, or disequilibrium syndrome. After the session, she reassesses the patient, documenting fluid removed and post-dialysis weight. This demonstrates the nurse’s specialized knowledge and vigilance in renal replacement therapy, ensuring safe and effective patient care.
A nurse in the surgical recovery area monitors a patient with a new colostomy. She inspects the stoma color, consistency, and surrounding skin integrity, ensuring it is pink and moist. The nurse teaches the patient proper stoma care, including how to empty and change the ostomy bag, maintain hygiene, and recognize signs of infection or irritation. Emotional support is provided to address the patient’s anxiety and body image concerns. This scenario shows the nurse’s responsibility in patient education, psychological adaptation, and promotion of self-care following major surgical alteration.
