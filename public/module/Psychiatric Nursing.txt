A nurse observes a patient admitted for major depressive disorder who appears withdrawn and speaks minimally. She establishes rapport using therapeutic communication techniques such as active listening and empathy, maintaining a calm and nonjudgmental tone. The nurse encourages verbal expression of feelings and assesses for suicidal ideation by directly asking open-ended questions. Environmental safety measures are implemented, including removing sharp objects from the patient’s surroundings. She collaborates with the psychiatric team in administering prescribed SSRIs and monitors for adverse effects like serotonin syndrome. This care approach highlights the nurse’s role in promoting emotional safety, early detection of risk, and fostering a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship in managing depression.
In the acute ward, a nurse cares for a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia who reports auditory hallucinations. She avoids arguing with the patient’s perceptions but acknowledges their experiences by saying, “I understand that you hear voices, but I don’t hear them.” The nurse redirects attention to reality-based activities and provides structured routines to reduce anxiety. She monitors adherence to antipsychotic medications like risperidone, observing for extrapyramidal symptoms such as tremors or rigidity. By promoting trust, maintaining boundaries, and reinforcing medication compliance, the nurse ensures stabilization and prevents relapse while maintaining a safe therapeutic environment.
A nurse assigned to a patient with bipolar I disorder observes signs of mania such as pressured speech, flight of ideas, and impulsive spending. She maintains a calm environment free from excessive stimulation, provides concise directions, and uses firm but gentle limits to control inappropriate behaviors. Nutrition and rest are prioritized; finger foods and quiet rest periods are encouraged to meet physiological needs. The nurse records sleep patterns, energy levels, and mood changes. Collaboration with the physician ensures appropriate administration of mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate, with monitoring of serum lithium levels to prevent toxicity. This demonstrates the nurse’s role in balancing emotional stability with physiological care in manic patients.
A nurse assists a patient admitted with panic disorder who experiences sudden shortness of breath, chest tightness, and trembling during an attack. She remains with the patient, offering reassurance and guiding slow, deep breathing to promote relaxation and prevent hyperventilation. The nurse uses grounding techniques, encouraging the patient to focus on the present environment to reduce anxiety. Vital signs are monitored to rule out cardiac complications. Once the panic subsides, the nurse discusses possible triggers and teaches cognitive-behavioral strategies for coping. Documentation of frequency, duration, and triggers aids in evaluating progress and treatment effectiveness.
During a psychiatric emergency, a nurse responds to a patient demonstrating aggressive behavior due to intermittent explosive disorder. She ensures safety by maintaining an appropriate distance, calling for assistance, and using a calm but firm voice. The nurse applies de-escalation techniques, such as setting clear limits and acknowledging the patient’s anger without confrontation. If necessary, chemical restraints are administered following institutional policy, and continuous monitoring is maintained. After the episode, she facilitates a debriefing session to help the patient explore alternative coping methods. This scenario reflects the nurse’s critical role in crisis management, maintaining safety, and employing therapeutic interventions under pressure.
A nurse conducts group therapy with patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. She facilitates open discussion, ensuring that each member participates and shares experiences. Using therapeutic communication, the nurse promotes trust and mutual respect within the group. She introduces progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and deep breathing exercises as non-pharmacologic interventions to reduce anxiety. The nurse evaluates participants’ engagement, emotional responses, and effectiveness of coping techniques. Documentation of progress is made in the nursing care plan to guide ongoing treatment. This illustrates the nurse’s role as a facilitator, educator, and supporter in the therapeutic milieu.
In a psychiatric outpatient setting, the nurse assists a patient recovering from substance use disorder. She conducts motivational interviewing to assess readiness for change, using nonjudgmental questioning to explore ambivalence. The nurse educates the patient on the physiological effects of drugs, relapse prevention strategies, and importance of social support systems. She coordinates with a multidisciplinary team, including counselors and social workers, to develop a rehabilitation plan. Periodic urine drug screening and attendance at support groups like Narcotics Anonymous are encouraged. Through compassionate care and accountability, the nurse empowers the patient toward sustained recovery and reintegration into society.
A nurse observes a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who repeatedly washes hands due to fear of contamination. She does not interrupt the ritual abruptly but gradually limits the time allowed for compulsive behavior. The nurse provides behavioral therapy support, reinforces positive coping methods, and educates on the importance of medication adherence to SSRIs. During interactions, she promotes trust and understanding of the disorder without reinforcing irrational beliefs. Progress is measured through decreased ritual frequency and anxiety levels. The nurse’s consistent and supportive presence aids the patient in regaining control and reducing the compulsive cycle.
A nurse attends to an adolescent patient showing signs of anorexia nervosa. She performs a thorough nutritional assessment, recording daily weight, dietary intake, and body mass index (BMI). The nurse supervises meals to prevent food disposal and provides a structured eating plan. Emotional support is prioritized by promoting self-esteem and addressing distorted body image. Collaboration with dietitians and psychiatrists ensures a comprehensive approach involving psychotherapy and nutritional rehabilitation. The nurse monitors for medical complications such as bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, and amenorrhea. Her role emphasizes the integration of physical, emotional, and behavioral care in treating eating disorders.
A nurse caring for a patient with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) observes symptoms of hypervigilance and nightmares. She creates a safe and quiet environment, ensuring that the patient feels secure. The nurse employs grounding exercises and assists in identifying trauma triggers. She listens actively, validates the patient’s experiences, and avoids forcing details of the trauma. Collaboration with the healthcare team ensures medication adherence to SSRIs or anxiolytics and referral to psychotherapy. Regular evaluation of sleep patterns and emotional responses helps in assessing progress. Through trust, empathy, and consistent support, the nurse plays a vital role in trauma recovery and emotional stabilization.
