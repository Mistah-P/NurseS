Before giving the drug, she checks the five rights of medication administration and explains the purpose, dosage, and possible side effects. The patient hesitates and refuses, stating he previously experienced rashes from similar medication. The nurse immediately stops the procedure, verifies the allergy record, and reports the concern to the physician. She documents the patient’s refusal and reassures him that his decision will be respected. This scenario demonstrates respect for patient autonomy, the ethical principle that allows individuals to make informed choices about their care. Instead of forcing compliance, the nurse advocates for safety and ensures a new prescription is issued.

This scenario highlights the ethical principle of veracity (truth-telling) and non-maleficence (doing no harm).

For example, when two patients request pain medication simultaneously, she attends first to the one whose vital signs indicate higher distress. This scenario portrays the ethical principle of justice, emphasizing fairness, equality, and impartiality in healthcare delivery. The nurse demonstrates ethical discernment by balancing compassion with clinical judgment, ensuring no patient feels neglected or discriminated against.
