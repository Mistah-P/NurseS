A nurse performs an initial head-to-toe assessment on a newly admitted patient. She begins with inspection, observing general appearance, hygiene, and posture. Using palpation, she assesses skin temperature, texture, and turgor to identify dehydration or edema. Percussion of the thorax helps determine resonance over lung fields, and dullness over the liver. Auscultation of breath sounds reveals clear vesicular sounds bilaterally, ruling out adventitious sounds like crackles or wheezes. The nurse documents findings using subjective data (patient’s complaints) and objective data (measurable observations). Through systematic assessment, she establishes a baseline database, ensuring accurate future comparison and effective care planning.
During a neurological assessment, the nurse evaluates a patient with suspected cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She assesses the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), checking eye opening, verbal, and motor responses to measure consciousness. Pupil assessment using a penlight identifies equality, size, and reactivity to light — normal being PERRLA (pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation). Cranial nerves I–XII are tested, observing for facial droop or slurred speech. Motor strength grading and sensation testing are performed on all extremities. The nurse records neurological deficits and notifies the physician promptly for early intervention. Accurate neurological assessment guides diagnosis, prevents deterioration, and supports effective rehabilitation planning.
A nurse conducts a cardiovascular assessment on a hypertensive patient. She inspects for jugular vein distension (JVD) and palpates the apical pulse at the fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line. Using a stethoscope, she auscultates heart sounds (S1 and S2) and identifies any murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Peripheral pulses are palpated and graded from 0 to +4 to assess circulation. Capillary refill time is checked for perfusion, and blood pressure is measured in both arms to detect discrepancies. Edema and cyanosis are noted as signs of poor cardiac output. Comprehensive cardiac assessment allows the nurse to detect heart failure or valvular abnormalities, contributing to early treatment and prevention of complications.
In the respiratory unit, the nurse assesses a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She observes chest expansion symmetry, use of accessory muscles, and respiratory rate and rhythm. Through auscultation, she identifies diminished breath sounds and prolonged expiratory phase, typical of COPD. Pulse oximetry shows oxygen saturation of 88%, prompting oxygen therapy per protocol. The nurse performs arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling and interprets results for hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. She documents dyspnea level using the Borg scale and encourages pursed-lip breathing to improve ventilation. This assessment ensures accurate recognition of respiratory compromise and guides individualized nursing interventions.
A nurse performs an abdominal assessment for a patient complaining of epigastric pain. She follows the correct sequence — inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. The abdomen appears flat and symmetrical. Bowel sounds are active in all quadrants upon auscultation. Percussion reveals tympany over the stomach and dullness over the liver. On palpation, the nurse notes tenderness in the right upper quadrant, possibly indicating cholecystitis. She checks for rebound tenderness, guarding, or masses. The nurse records findings and prepares the patient for ultrasound imaging as ordered. Understanding anatomical landmarks and systematic approach ensures accurate data collection and supports differential diagnosis in gastrointestinal assessment.
In the emergency department, the nurse conducts a pain assessment using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and PQRST method — Provocation, Quality, Region, Severity, and Timing. The patient reports sharp, constant pain in the lower abdomen rated 8/10. The nurse assesses nonverbal cues like grimacing and guarding. She checks vital signs — elevated heart rate and blood pressure indicating pain distress. Analgesic administration is done per physician’s order, and the pain level is reassessed after 30 minutes to evaluate effectiveness. Accurate pain assessment helps determine treatment efficacy, enhances patient comfort, and guides ongoing care. It also supports the nurse’s advocacy role in pain management.
A nurse performs a musculoskeletal assessment on a patient post–hip surgery. She inspects for alignment, swelling, and deformity. Range of motion (ROM) exercises are evaluated — active and passive — to assess joint mobility. Muscle strength is graded using the Lovett scale, with normal being grade 5. The nurse palpates for tenderness or crepitus and checks gait stability with an assistive device. She instructs proper body mechanics and fall prevention measures to promote safety during ambulation. Documentation of improvement or limitation supports rehabilitation goals. This comprehensive musculoskeletal assessment ensures safe recovery, detects complications, and fosters mobility independence.
During a skin and integumentary assessment, the nurse observes color, moisture, texture, and lesions. She notes cyanosis on the lips and nail beds, indicating hypoxia. Turgor testing reveals delayed recoil, suggesting dehydration. The nurse inspects pressure areas using the Braden Scale to assess risk for pressure ulcers. She notes a Stage II pressure injury on the sacrum and applies a sterile dressing after cleansing. Education on frequent repositioning and adequate hydration is reinforced. The nurse documents findings with detailed wound description — size, color, drainage, and odor. This scenario emphasizes early skin assessment and preventive care, reducing infection risk and promoting healing.
A nurse carries out a genitourinary assessment on a patient with urinary tract infection (UTI). She inspects the suprapubic area for distention and palpates for tenderness. The nurse observes urine color, clarity, and odor, noting cloudy urine with foul smell. Urinalysis reveals positive nitrites and leukocytes, confirming infection. She encourages increased fluid intake, monitors urine output, and teaches perineal hygiene. Pain is assessed using the Wong-Baker FACES scale if the patient is nonverbal. The nurse documents dysuria, urgency, and frequency, supporting physician evaluation. Systematic genitourinary assessment ensures early detection and management of urinary abnormalities.
Lastly, a nurse performs a mental status examination (MSE) for a patient with behavioral changes. She evaluates appearance, behavior, speech, mood, thought process, cognition, and perception. The patient appears disheveled, with flat affect and slow speech. Orientation to time, place, and person is assessed using simple questions. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) yields a score indicating mild cognitive impairment. The nurse ensures a safe and nonjudgmental environment during the interview. Findings are communicated to the healthcare team for psychiatric evaluation. This scenario highlights the importance of comprehensive psychosocial and cognitive assessment in promoting holistic patient care and identifying mental health concerns early.
