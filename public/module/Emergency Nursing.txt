A patient arrives at the emergency department following a motorcycle accident. The nurse immediately performs a primary survey using the ABCDE approach—assessing airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure. She stabilizes the cervical spine, checks for hemorrhage, and starts two large-bore IV lines for fluid resuscitation. Oxygen is administered via a non-rebreather mask, and vital signs are closely monitored. The nurse assists the trauma team with rapid sequence intubation and prepares for possible blood transfusion. Continuous assessment and effective communication with the physician ensure rapid decision-making. Her critical thinking, quick prioritization, and adherence to trauma protocols demonstrate the essential role of the emergency nurse in stabilizing patients with life-threatening injuries.
A middle-aged man presents with severe chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw. The nurse immediately attaches the patient to a cardiac monitor and obtains a 12-lead ECG. Oxygen therapy is initiated, and aspirin is administered as ordered. She establishes IV access, monitors vital signs every five minutes, and prepares nitroglycerin and morphine for pain relief. The nurse remains alert for signs of cardiac arrest, keeping the defibrillator and crash cart ready. Clear documentation and continuous ECG interpretation allow early identification of myocardial infarction. By coordinating with the cardiac team and maintaining calm reassurance, the nurse helps reduce the patient’s anxiety while ensuring timely intervention that can save his life.
A young woman is rushed in after an episode of anaphylaxis from a food allergy. The nurse assesses airway patency and quickly administers intramuscular epinephrine as prescribed. Oxygen is delivered via face mask, and IV fluids are initiated to maintain perfusion. She continuously monitors the patient’s oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure while preparing additional doses of epinephrine if necessary. The nurse also provides education to the patient’s family about the use of an epinephrine auto-injector and the importance of avoiding triggers. Quick recognition and adherence to emergency protocols prevent respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse. Her composure under pressure and understanding of pathophysiology highlight the importance of preparedness in emergency care.
An elderly patient is brought in after collapsing at home. The nurse assesses level of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale and checks for carotid pulse and spontaneous breathing. When no pulse is detected, she immediately begins high-quality CPR following Basic Life Support (BLS) guidelines. The defibrillator is applied, and automated external defibrillation (AED) is performed. After return of spontaneous circulation, the nurse ensures airway security and assists in post-resuscitation monitoring. She documents the time of collapse, interventions, and outcomes accurately. The nurse provides emotional support to family members waiting outside, explaining procedures with compassion. This scenario showcases the emergency nurse’s skill in life-saving measures, teamwork, and maintaining composure in high-stress cardiac arrest situations.
A toddler is rushed to the emergency department after swallowing detergent pods. The nurse ensures airway patency and prevents aspiration by positioning the child laterally. She avoids inducing vomiting and contacts poison control for specific management guidelines. Activated charcoal is prepared as ordered, and vital signs are continuously monitored. The nurse provides reassurance to the distressed parents while explaining the dangers of household toxins. Child safety education is reinforced before discharge. Pediatric emergencies require calm precision, immediate response, and the ability to think critically under pressure while offering family-centered care.
A construction worker arrives with a deep laceration and active bleeding after an accident. The nurse applies direct pressure with sterile gauze to control hemorrhage and elevates the injured limb. She assesses distal pulses and sensation to ensure circulation. Tetanus immunization status is verified, and wound cleaning is performed under aseptic technique. The nurse prepares the patient for suturing and possible surgical referral while continuously monitoring vital signs. Pain management and reassurance are provided throughout the procedure. Effective emergency wound care demands attention to bleeding control, infection prevention, and patient comfort.
A diabetic patient is brought in unconscious with clammy skin and a blood glucose level of 36 mg/dL. The nurse immediately administers 50% dextrose intravenously as ordered and reassesses the patient’s responsiveness after a few minutes. Vital signs and glucose levels are closely monitored. Once the patient regains consciousness, the nurse provides a snack to maintain blood sugar and educates about regular meal schedules and insulin use. Rapid intervention prevents hypoglycemic coma and potential brain injury. The nurse’s swift action and accurate assessment demonstrate competence in managing metabolic emergencies.


A teenage patient arrives with shortness of breath and wheezing due to an acute asthma attack. The nurse positions the patient in high Fowler’s to maximize lung expansion and initiates nebulized bronchodilator therapy. She assesses lung sounds before and after treatment, monitors oxygen saturation, and encourages slow, deep breathing. Anxiety is managed through calm reassurance and guided relaxation. The nurse also educates the patient on proper inhaler use and avoidance of known allergens. Early recognition and aggressive management of airway obstruction are crucial in preventing respiratory failure in asthmatic patients.
During a mass casualty incident involving a bus crash, the emergency nurse assists in triage using the START system—Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment. She categorizes victims according to the urgency of care: immediate, delayed, minor, or deceased. Despite the chaos, she maintains composure and delegates tasks effectively among team members. Documentation of triage tags and resource allocation is maintained. The nurse demonstrates leadership, teamwork, and ethical judgment in prioritizing limited resources for maximum survival. Emergency nurses play a key role in disaster preparedness and coordination during large-scale emergencies.
A patient arrives in the emergency department with seizure activity. The nurse ensures safety by clearing the area of harmful objects, positions the patient on the side to prevent aspiration, and avoids inserting anything into the mouth. After the seizure subsides, she assesses level of consciousness, vital signs, and neurological status. Anticonvulsant medication is administered as ordered. The nurse provides postictal care and emotional reassurance. Education about medication adherence and seizure precautions follows. Effective seizure management involves clinical vigilance, safety maintenance, and patient-centered care during and after an episode.
