Fundamentals of Nursing Practice

Easy
Integrating health promotion and disease prevention is demonstrated when the nurse provides patient education before discharge. The teaching covers crucial areas like medication management, diet, and follow-up appointments. To ensure the patient genuinely understands the instructions and complex details, the nurse employs the teach-back method. She strongly encourages adherence to the prescribed treatment and emphasizes the necessity of reporting any potential side effects. This demonstrates how the fundamentals of nursing extend beyond bedside procedures, encompassing advocacy and ensuring continuity of care. Furthermore, adherence to ethical and legal standards includes rigorous documentation using the SOAPIE format. Even verbal orders must be repeated back to the prescriber to confirm accuracy, ensuring that the nursing record serves as a robust legal record protecting both the patient and the nurse. 

Utilizing the principles of self-care and patient autonomy promoted by Dorothea Orem’s theory, the nurse assists an elderly patient in ambulating. The nurse uses a gait belt and walker, performing a thorough safety check to ensure non-slip footwear and a clear walking path. Applying ergonomic principles and implementing comprehensive fall prevention strategies are vital to providing support while encouraging the patient’s independence. The nurse assesses for signs like dizziness or weakness during ambulation and meticulously records findings. Prior to discharge, the nurse transitions into the role of educator and advocate, providing detailed patient education on medication management, diet, and follow-up appointments. To confirm true comprehension, she employs the teach-back method. This demonstrates how the fundamentals encompass health teaching, advocacy, and continuity of care, empowering individuals to take responsibility for their own health. 

The foundation of professional care involves ensuring patient safety and ethical accountability through adherence to standard protocols. A nurse must consistently perform hand hygiene using the five moments of handwashing and properly utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) gloves, mask, and gown—before entering a patient’s room. This practice applies the principles of medical asepsis to prevent cross-contamination while administering oral medication. Central to this is verifying the five rights of medication administration: right patient, right drug, right dose, right route, and right time. Furthermore, a nurse uses the nursing process as a systematic framework, applying the ADPIE framework (Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Implementation, Evaluation) which emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and clinical judgment. Accurate record-keeping is maintained following the SOAPIE format (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, Intervention, and Evaluation), which serves as a legal record of nursing actions. This meticulous approach reinforces the core ethical commitment: do no harm and maintain integrity in all nursing interventions. 

Normal
Accurate documentation (e.g., SOAPIE charting) is a legal accountability. When managing total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or crystalloid IV solutions, the nurse calculates the gtt/min (drops/minute) flow rate. Continuous monitoring of the peripheral IV (PIV) site is crucial, assessing for complications like thrombophlebitis (a clot with inflammation), infiltration (cool/swollen), or extravasation (tissue-damaging). Any adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or signs of fluid volume overload (FVO) necessitate prompt physician (MD) notification. Managing the patient's physiological homeostasis is a core component of this meticulous adherence to facility-specific P&P (policies and procedures).
Engaging a preoperative (pre-op) patient requires advanced therapeutic communication. The nurse must assess for somatization of anxiety, where psychological distress manifests as physical symptoms. Before establishing IV access, she checks for allergies (e.g., chlorhexidine). She prepares an 18-gauge (18g) angiocatheter for the antecubital fossa (AC). She must ensure patency (openness) and strict aseptic technique, swabbing the "hub" for >=15 seconds. She assesses the site for erythema (redness), edema, or purulent drainage, and documents I&O (intake/output) to monitor fluid balance, thus preventing iatrogenic (hospital-acquired) complications.
Managing postoperative (post-op) physiological stability requires vigilant monitoring. The nurse assesses a patient using a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) pump. She monitors vital signs (VS), including SpO2 (oxygen saturation), for signs of respiratory depression. She checks the IV site for phlebitis (streaking, warmth) or infiltration (coolness, swelling). Accurate I&O monitoring is crucial, especially for patients who are NPO (nothing by mouth). She must differentiate between expected post-op pain and new-onset complications, such as atelectasis (partial lung collapse) or DVT (deep vein thrombosis), demonstrating clinical judgment beyond basic ADPIE.

Hard 

Managing a hemodynamically unstable patient with nosocomial pneumonia (HAP/VAP) requires interpreting complex pathophysiological changes. The nurse monitors for septicemia or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Vital signs (VS) are critical: a BP < 90/60 mmHg, HR > 110 bpm, or SpO2 < 90% on 6L/min O2 via nasal cannula (NC) indicates acute decompensation. Understanding homeostasis is key. The nurse must recognize tachypnea (RR > 24) and dyspnea as signs of impending acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She must titrate O2, manage IV vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine), and monitor the patient's neurological status using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

The nursing process guides care for a post-laparotomy patient with multiple co-morbidities (e.g., DMII, HTN). The NANDA-I diagnosis: "Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion r/t (related to) compromised blood flow 2 degrees (secondary to) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)." Planning (using NIC/NOC) involves measurable goals. Implementation includes meticulous wound care, assessing the incision for dehiscence or evisceration. The nurse administers prophylactic enoxaparin (Lovenox) 0.5mg/kg to prevent DVT/PE. Evaluation focuses on neurovascular assessments (e.g., capillary refill < 3 sec, pedal pulses 2+). This structured ADPIE/SOAPIE methodology, integrating evidence-based practice (EBP), is the foundation of patient-centered care.

Adherence to surgical asepsis is non-negotiable in the perioperative environment. This involves meticulous antiseptic hand hygiene (e.g., chlorhexidine gluconate) and maintaining a sterile field (1-inch border) during procedures like central venous catheter (CVC) insertion. The nurse ensures correct nosocomial infection control, including color-coded biohazardous waste segregation and sharps disposal (puncture-proof). This prevents iatrogenic complications and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), such as CAUTI (catheter-associated urinary tract infection) or CLABSI (central line-associated bloodstream infection). This commitment to a sterile microenvironment is paramount.

Providing care for an immobilized, cachectic patient requires advanced application of ergonomic principles and pressure injury (PI) prevention. The nurse assesses bony prominences (e.g., sacrum, coccyx, trochanters, scapulae) for non-blanchable erythema, indicating a Stage 1 PI. She implements a Q2H (every 2 hours) turning schedule, utilizing draw-sheets to prevent shear/friction. Principles of kinesiology (body mechanics) prevent musculoskeletal injuries (MSIs) to the nurse. She must assess incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) and differentiate it from pressure-related tissue damage, applying appropriate barrier emollients or hydrocolloid dressings.

Health Assessment Terminologies

The nurse begins a comprehensive assessment by gathering subjective data through an interview, using open-ended questions to elicit the chief complaint. The health history covers the present illness, past medical history, family history, and social habits like smoking and alcohol use. To meticulously detail the patient’s pain, the nurse applies the complex OLDCART mnemonic Onset, Location, Duration, Characteristics, Aggravating factors, Relieving factors, and Treatment. Observational skills are key in the general survey, where the nurse notes level of consciousness, gait, posture, hygiene, and nutritional status. She observes signs of distress such as labored breathing, pallor, or diaphoresis. Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) are recorded for nutritional evaluation. The integration of subjective complaints and measurable objective data forms the crucial baseline database for effective care planning. (185 words)
In the emergency department, a detailed pain assessment is executed using standardized scales and methods. The nurse employs the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) or, if necessary, the Wong-Baker FACES scale for nonverbal patients. A critical systematic approach is the PQRST method of Provocation, Quality, Region, Severity, and Timing to gather detailed information. Elevated vital signs like increased heart rate and blood pressure often indicate pain distress. The nurse also observes key nonverbal cues like grimacing and guarding. Following analgesic administration, the pain level is meticulously reassessed after 30 minutes to evaluate treatment efficacy. This comprehensive assessment enhances patient comfort and supports the nurse’s advocacy role in pain management. Accurate pain assessment remains a key aspect of nursing assessment.

For the genitourinary assessment, the nurse gathers data on urinary patterns, frequency, color, and odor. Specific symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria, or incontinence are investigated. Palpation of the bladder determines distension or tenderness. If a urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected, the nurse observes for cloudy urine with foul smell, and laboratory results (Urinalysis) may reveal positive nitrites and leukocytes. The nurse uses precise medical terms like oliguria, polyuria, and anuria to describe findings related to renal function. Strict monitoring of fluid intake and output is essential for tracking hydration status. By maintaining dignity, privacy, and sensitivity during the procedure, the nurse adheres to ethical standards while ensuring early identification and management of urinary abnormalities. (174 words)

A systematic respiratory assessment (using the IPPA-sequence) involves inspection for eupnea (12-20 breaths/min), tachypnea (>20), or dyspnea. Palpation checks for tactile fremitus. Auscultation (post-cough) identifies vesicular or bronchovesicular sounds. Adventitious sounds (e.g., crackles, wheezes, stridor) are documented. Findings like "Lungs CTA" (clear to auscultation) vs. "diminished RLL" (right lower lobe) r/t (related to) atelectasis are critical. The use of accessory muscles or orthopnea (difficulty breathing flat) in a COPD patient (with SpO2 <90%) necessitates prompt intervention.
Assessing the GI system requires a specific sequence: inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation (IAPP). Auscultation (in all 4 quadrants) identifies bowel sounds (BS) normoactive, hypoactive, or hyperactive (borborygmi). Percussion reveals tympany (gas) or dullness (fluid/feces). Light palpation is assessed for tenderness (rebound) or rigidity (board-like abdomen). The nurse documents N/V/D (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) and assesses for hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Signs of peritonitis or acute appendicitis (RLQ pain) require immediate MD notification (STAT).

For the musculoskeletal (MSK) assessment, the nurse observes gait/posture and active/passive range of motion (ROM) e.g., flexion, extension, abduction. Palpation may reveal crepitus (grinding) or edema. Muscle strength is graded (0-5 scale) for RUE/LUE (upper extremities) and RLE/LLE (lower extremities). A positive Romberg test indicates balance deficits. The nurse inspects for spinal lordosis, kyphosis, or scoliosis. Documenting "limited adduction R-hip 2/2 (secondary to) pain" is crucial for post-op (THR) rehab. Fall-prevention protocols (e.g., non-skid socks) are initiated.

Hard

The cardiovascular (CV) assessment evaluates hemodynamic stability. Inspection for jugular vein distension (JVD) > 3cm (at 45 degrees) suggests fluid volume excess (FVE). Palpation identifies the point of maximal impulse (PMI) and peripheral pulses (e.g., dorsalis pedis) graded 0-4+. The nurse checks for thrills (vibrations). Auscultation (using diaphragm/bell) over Erb's point detects S1/S2, murmurs (e.g., systolic/diastolic), or S3/S4 gallops. An apical-radial pulse deficit often signifies atrial fibrillation (A-fib). This assessment, combined with an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), is crucial for diagnosing valvular stenosis or congestive heart failure (CHF).
A critical neurological assessment evaluates cerebrovascular integrity. Level of consciousness (LOC) is trended via the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Score: 3-15). Pupil assessment PERRLA (Pupils Equal, Round, Reactive to Light and Accommodation) is vital. The nurse tests Cranial Nerves (CN I-XII) and motor strength (0-5), noting hemiplegia or hemiparesis. Deficits like dysarthria (slurred speech), aphasia (expressive/receptive), or nystagmus (eye twitching) are documented. For a suspected cerebrovascular accident (CVA), the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is initiated STAT to rule-in/rule-out thrombolytic (t-PA) therapy.
The integumentary assessment inspects for cyanosis (bluish), erythema (redness), jaundice (yellowish), or pallor. Skin turgor (recoil < 2 sec) assesses hydration. The nurse documents lesions (e.g., macules, papules, vesicles) and petechiae. Pitting edema is graded (+1 to +4). The Braden Scale (<18 = high risk) quantifies pressure injury (PI) risk. A Stage II PI on the coccyx (sacrum) requires documentation of size (L/W/D in cm), exudate (serous/sanguineous/purulent), and periwound condition. This prevents maceration and progression.
A comprehensive head/neck assessment involves inspecting the normocephalic head and palpating lymph nodes (preauricular, submandibular, supraclavicular), noting lymphadenopathy (infection/malignancy). The nurse checks for tracheal deviation or thyromegaly. Auscultation (with the bell) over the carotid arteries detects bruits (turbulent flow). The Mental Status Examination (MSE) assesses appearance, affect (e.g., flat/labile), cognition, and thought process (e.g., circumstantial/tangential). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (max score 30) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) objectively screens for neurocognitive impairment.

Health Education

Easy 
The occupational health nurse conducts a seminar on ergonomics and injury prevention for factory workers, employing multimedia presentations, simulation, and hands-on demonstration to teach proper lifting techniques and posture correction. A crucial technical aspect involves explaining the importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) and safe handling of chemicals following strict OSHA standards. A needs assessment tailors the content to specific workplace hazards. This educational intervention reduces workplace injuries and enhances employee safety awareness, illustrating the nurse’s leadership in applying both preventive and promotive strategies. In caring for children, the school health nurse uses age-appropriate teaching strategies like storytelling, demonstrating proper handwashing techniques and balanced diet planning following the structured Food Pyramid Guide. 

When training senior citizens, the nurse focuses on enhancing health literacy. This involves careful assessment of their cognitive ability and reading level to ensure the use of appropriate methods, such as large-print visual aids and simplifying dense medical terminologies. Using real-life examples and incorporating repetition and reinforcement enhances memory retention. The educational goal is to empower older adults in areas like medication safety and fall prevention. In the workplace, the occupational health nurse must ensure compliance with rigorous OSHA standards when teaching ergonomics and injury prevention. She performs a needs assessment to tailor education about personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper lifting techniques, demonstrating her role in applying both preventive and promotive strategies to maintain worker well-being. 

When providing postpartum health education, the nurse teaches technical skills like perineal care and breastfeeding techniques. Crucially, she discusses the psychological symptoms associated with postpartum depression. The nurse applies structured learning models like Gagne’s Nine Events of Instruction and encourages family involvement. She evaluates understanding through verbal feedback and observation of practices. Key nutritional advice includes promoting exclusive breastfeeding for six months and educating about various family planning methods. In preoperative settings, the nurse addresses patient anxiety while explaining complex concepts like anesthesia and the function of the incentive spirometer. Effective preoperative teaching is a critical component of the preparation phase that dramatically enhances patient cooperation, reduces fear, and improves challenging postoperative outcomes. 

Medium 
The public health nurse organizes a hypertension (HTN) awareness program.  DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) and strict reduction of sodium (Na+) intake. Evaluation of learning (pre/post-test) is structured. Similarly, the nurse ensures discharge teaching for a patient post-myocardial infarction (MI). This includes medication adherence (beta-blockers), a low-fat/low-cholesterol diet (for hyperlipidemia), and cardiac rehabilitation (rehab). The nurse integrates the cognitive-behavioral approach (CBT) to modify behaviors (smoking, diet), aiming for secondary prevention and improved QoL (quality of life). 
For senior citizens (gerontology), the nurse conducts health literacy training. She assesses factors (e.g., cognition) to adapt materials (e.g., large-print) and simplify terminologies (re: polypharmacy). Topics include medication safety (% of errors), nutrition, and fall prevention. In maternal-child health (MCH), the nurse provides postpartum education, teaching perineal care and lactation (breastfeeding) techniques. She screens for postpartum depression (PPD) and educates on complications like mastitis. She uses Gagne’s Nine Events of Instruction to structure the learning. 
For a patient post-myocardial infarction (MI), discharge teaching is comprehensive. Essential topics include medication adherence (e.g., anti-platelets, statins), managing angina (e.g., sublingual NTG use), and cardiac rehabilitation. The nurse teaches self-monitoring (pulse-check, BP log) and the cognitive-behavioral approach for stress management (re: dysrhythmias). In the community, the nurse uses participatory learning for hypertension (HTN) awareness, demonstrating BP monitoring and explaining the DASH diet (sodium < 1,500mg/day). 
Hard 

The nurse assesses readiness (e.g., affective/cognitive domains) for a patient with Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2 DM). She teaches insulin pharmacokinetics (onset/peak/duration) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Evaluation (via return-demonstration) confirms psychomotor competence. The teaching covers chronic microvascular complications (e.g., neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy). In perioperative teaching (pre-op), the nurse explains post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) protocols, incentive spirometry (IS), and early ambulation to prevent atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) / pulmonary embolism (PE). 


The nurse designs a tertiary prevention campaign for smoking cessation, integrating Pender’s Health Promotion Model and the Transtheoretical Model (e.g., precontemplation/contemplation). She explains the pathophysiology of emphysema (a type of COPD) and the risk of carcinogens (re: lung cancer). The epidemiological impact is stressed. In a primary prevention setting (for hypertension / HBP), she introduces the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), linking reduced Na+ (<1,500mg) to decreased risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and other co-morbidities. 

Preoperative teaching for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Lap-Chole) involves complex physiological concepts (e.g., NPO status, pre-anesthesia protocols). The nurse uses the teach-back method to confirm understanding of prophylactic measures (e.g., IS, anticoagulants) to prevent atelectasis and thrombophlebitis (DVT). Teaching a patient with co-morbid Diabetes Mellitus (DM) focuses on managing hyperglycemia (e.g., HbA1c < 7%) to prevent wound dehiscence and chronic microvascular complications (e.g., neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy). 

A nurse researcher uses a quasi-experimental (pretest-posttest) design to evaluate an educational intervention's efficacy (e.g., asthma pathophysiology knowledge). Statistical analysis (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) is applied to quantitative data. Findings (re: reliability/validity) are disseminated. In school health, the nurse applies Bloom’s Taxonomy to ensure learning across cognitive (knowledge), affective (attitudes), and psychomotor (e.g., MDI / metered-dose inhaler use) domains. This pedagogical approach is used to teach nutrition (MyPlate vs. Food Pyramid) and oral hygiene. 

Theoretical Foundations in Nursing
Easy 
In the psychiatric environment, the nurse utilizes Hildegard Peplau’s Interpersonal Relations Theory, which highlights the therapeutic nurse–patient relationship. The nurse recognizes the distinct phases of the relationship (orientation, working, and termination) as essential for building trust. When a patient is anxious, the nurse employs therapeutic techniques such as active listening, empathy, and clarification to promote emotional expression. Peplau’s framework allows the nurse to function as a resource person, counselor, and teacher, guiding the patient toward understanding their behavior and achieving personal growth. This theory positions nursing as both a science and an art of human interaction. Contrastingly, Jean Watson’s Theory of Human Caring emphasizes transpersonal caring by establishing a deep, empathetic connection, applying the Ten Carative Factors such as cultivating loving-kindness and instilling faith and hope. 
When managing chronic illnesses in the community, the nurse employs Dorothea Orem’s Self-Care Deficit Theory. The nurse assesses specific self-care requisites like medication adherence and nutrition, identifying deficits that necessitate intervention, such as an inability to independently prepare meals. The nursing intervention then utilizes a supportive–educative system, teaching clients how to maintain self-care despite physical limitations. Evaluation involves observing adherence to care routines. Orem’s theory promotes self-efficacy while maintaining the client’s dignity. Another foundational principle is Florence Nightingale’s Environmental Theory. This historical framework emphasizes that a clean environment promotes healing, highlighting the importance of sanitation, ventilation, and light. Modern application of this theory includes teaching students stringent infection control and aseptic techniques, connecting historical principles with current IPC standards. 
Jean Watson’s Theory of Human Caring transforms technical care into a healing relationship. In pediatric oncology, the nurse establishes a deep, empathetic connection with the child and parents. The integration of transpersonal caring and the Ten Carative Factors (e.g., creating a supportive environment) ensures that caring and compassion are central to the profession. During painful procedures, the nurse maintains therapeutic presence and provides comfort through reassuring communication. This nurturing approach addresses both physical healing and emotional well-being. Similarly, Hildegard Peplau’s Interpersonal Relations Theory focuses on the therapeutic use of self, guiding the nurse through the orientation, working, and termination phases to help patients achieve emotional stability and develop effective coping mechanisms through guided reflection. 
Normal
A nurse applies Virginia Henderson’s Need Theory, focusing on 14 fundamental needs. This mandates assisting the patient in performing activities of daily living (ADLs). The nurse assesses independence in ambulation, hygiene, and elimination. The theoretical principle guides the nurse to reduce assistance (with post-op ROM exercises) as the patient gains strength. This ensures physiological and psychological needs are met. In rehab, Sister Callista Roy’s Adaptation Model is used. This involves assessing four adaptive modes (physiological, self-concept, role function, interdependence) to design interventions promoting neuro-adaptation post-CVA (stroke).

The nurse manager uses Patricia Benner’s Novice to Expert Theory (N2E) for staff matriculation. Benner identifies 5 levels of clinical competence (novice to expert). The manager uses situational coaching and reflective practice to guide nurses from decontextualized knowledge to intuitive clinical judgment. This enhances evidence-based practice (EBP). Simultaneously, applying Imogene King’s Theory of Goal Attainment (TGA) in the intensive care unit (ICU) involves establishing measurable goals (e.g., weaning parameters) with the patient’s family/proxy. King's emphasis on transactional relationships ensures mutual goal-setting leads to effective outcomes (e.g., modifying the NCP).

Applying Imogene King’s Theory of Goal Attainment (TGA) requires strong communication. In the ICU, caring for a patient (post-CABG) with an endotracheal tube (ETT) involves collaborating with the family to set measurable goals (e.g., extubation readiness). King's concept of transactional relationships ensures shared decision-making. Conversely, Dorothea Orem’s Self-Care Deficit Theory (SCDT) guides interventions for a patient with congestive heart failure (CHF). The nurse identifies deficits in self-care requisites (managing a low-Na+ diet / <1,500mg) and implements a supportive-educative system, promoting self-efficacy.
Hard 
In a nosocomial outbreak (e.g., VRE / MRSA), the nurse applies Betty Neuman’s Systems Model. This framework identifies intrapersonal, interpersonal, and extrapersonal stressors. Neuman’s model structures interventions: primary prevention (strengthening the flexible line of defense, e.g., hand hygiene compliance > 95%), secondary prevention (early case-finding/treatment after invasion of the normal line of defense), and tertiary prevention (reconstitution/rehabilitation post-illness, e.g., managing post-infectious sequelae). This systems-based approach seeks homeostasis (system stability).

Madeleine Leininger’s Transcultural Nursing (TCN) Theory is essential for ethnonursing. The nurse conducts a comprehensive culturalogical assessment to understand the client's emic (insider) worldview, health-related beliefs, and folk-healing practices. The theory mandates culturally congruent care (e.g., preservation/accommodation) and avoiding cultural imposition or ethnocentrism. Concurrently, Sister Callista Roy’s Adaptation Model (RAM) helps assess a post-hemiplegia patient's four adaptive modes. The nurse identifies focal stimuli (e.g., neurological deficit) and contextual/residual stimuli (e.g., social support) impacting the cognator subsystem, designing interventions to promote positive adaptation.

In leadership, Benner’s Novice to Expert Theory provides a framework for professional synergy. The manager uses experiential learning (e.g., high-fidelity simulation) to guide staff from decontextualized rule-following (novice) to intuitive, arational clinical judgment (expert). This supports a professional practice model (PPM). On the macro-level, Betty Neuman’s Systems Model manages complex epidemiological interactions (e.g., a vector-borne disease outbreak). Primary prevention (e.g., source-reduction) strengthens the community's flexible line of defense (FLD). The model requires intersectoral linkages (e.g., government/NGOs) to monitor outcomes and prevent system-wide disequilibrium.

Community Health Nursing
Easy 
The community nurse leads a family planning education program in low-income settings. Counseling involves explaining various methods both natural and artificial including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and oral contraceptives. The nurse addresses common misconceptions while maintaining a nonjudgmental approach that respects cultural and religious beliefs. She encourages joint decision-making for responsible parenthood. The nurse also responds to outbreaks, such as a rise in mosquito-borne illnesses. She teaches the specific four-part 4S strategy: Search and destroy breeding sites, Self-protection measures, Seek early consultation, and Support fogging. She mobilizes community officials for a clean-up drive to eliminate stagnant water. This mobilization and environmental sanitation demonstrate the importance of intersectoral collaboration in vector control. 
During disaster preparedness, the nurse trains residents in basic first aid, evacuation procedures, and emergency supply preparation. She plays a key role in helping the barangay create a formal disaster risk reduction plan, specifically identifying vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and pregnant women. Simulation drills are organized to ensure coordination and readiness. This role integrates health education with community mobilization, enhancing resilience during natural disasters. In the maternal health program, the nurse uses the risk assessment tool to identify and refer high-risk pregnancies. She provides detailed education on specific danger signs during pregnancy. Her continuous promotion of exclusive breastfeeding and complete immunization reflects the commitment to reducing maternal and infant mortality rates. 
The nurse who leads disaster preparedness seminars focuses on community resilience. Training includes basic first aid and organizing simulation drills to ensure operational readiness. Helping the community define its formal disaster risk reduction plan and identify vulnerable groups underscores her leadership role. This effort integrates health education with community mobilization. Through the community diagnosis approach, the nurse identifies deeply rooted issues like poor sanitation. She coordinates with barangay health workers for clean-up and implements teaching on safe water storage and handwashing. This embodiment of the principles of primary health care ensures that health and safety are continuous priorities, even amid adversity. 
Medium 
The community health nurse (CHN) conducts home visits, assessing living conditions (water source/sanitation). Utilizing the community diagnosis approach, she identifies prevalent issues (malnutrition, diarrhea). Education focuses on Primary Health Care (PHC). Collaboration with Barangay Health Workers (BHWs). In the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), the nurse manages the cold chain system (maintaining +2 degrees C to +8C) to ensure vaccine potency. She uses aseptic technique (70% alcohol swab) during vaccine administration, strengthening herd immunity (target >90%).
The school health nurse implements a screening program. She checks visual acuity (Snellen chart), dental health (re: dental caries), and anthropometric measurements (e.g., Ht/Wt). Referrals are made to the Rural Health Unit (RHU). This early detection promotes academic performance. In Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) management, the nurse organizes hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) screening, conducting capillary blood glucose (CBG) testing and counseling on pharmacotherapeutic compliance.
In implementing an immunization outreach program, the nurse’s primary responsibility is managing the cold chain system (e.g., vaccine transport) to guarantee vaccine efficacy. She educates on the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule (BCG, OPV, Penta). Adherence to aseptic technique (e.g., correct gauge/length needle) and monitoring for adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are non-negotiable. For dengue awareness (a vector-borne disease), she teaches the 4S strategy (Search/Destroy) to control the Aedes aegypti mosquito.
Hard 
In Maternal and Child Health (MCH), the nurse provides antenatal (pre-natal) care. This includes risk assessment (e.g., screening for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes) and birth preparedness. This approach aims to reduce maternal mortality ratios (MMR) and infant mortality rates (IMR). Simultaneously, during a tuberculosis (TB) case-finding campaign, she refers suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear or Xpert MTB/RIF testing under the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) program, monitoring adherence to prevent multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
Responding to an acute gastroenteritis (AGE) outbreak, the nurse performs epidemiologic data gathering (e.g., line-listing, spot maps) and coordinates stool specimen (e.g., Cary-Blair medium) collection for laboratory confirmation. Collaboration with the sanitation inspector (e.g., RSI) ensures assessment of local fomites and food/water safety. Critical health education is provided on food hygiene and oral rehydration therapy (ORT) using Oresol (oral rehydration salts). This rapid response showcases effective disease surveillance (using FHSIS forms) and outbreak management.
tuberculosis (TB) case-finding refers to suspected cases (e.g., cough > 2 weeks) for sputum microscopy (AFB smear) or Xpert MTB/RIF testing under the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) protocol. The nurse’s role is critical in ensuring treatment adherence (e.g., 6-month regimen) to prevent multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) prevention, she conducts BP monitoring (screening for HTN) and capillary blood glucose (CBG) testing (screening for DM), providing counseling on pharmacotherapy and tertiary prevention.

Leading a family planning (FP) program requires counseling on intrauterine devices (IUDs), progestin-only injectables (DMPA), and bilateral tubal ligation (BTL), respecting ethno-religious beliefs. When responding to an acute gastroenteritis (AGE) outbreak, the nurse initiates epidemiologic data gathering (e.g., creating an epidemic curve). She coordinates with the sanitation inspector (RSI) and provides oral rehydration therapy (ORT). This illustrates effective disease surveillance, outbreak management, and interprofessional teamwork to maintain public health homeostasis.
Nutrition and Dietetics
Easy 
In the oncology unit, the nurse assesses the nutritional status of a patient undergoing chemotherapy who presents with severe anorexia and taste alteration. The strategy involves implementing small, frequent, high-calorie meals supported by oral nutritional supplements. She recommends bland or cold foods to minimize the metallic taste and nausea. Crucial to treatment tolerance is maintaining hydration to counter losses from vomiting or diarrhea. The nurse uses nutritional counseling and behavior modification to improve intake. Regular weight monitoring and biochemical assessments are performed to track progress. For elderly clients, managing dysphagia is critical; the nurse provides modified texture diets and uses thickened fluids to prevent the severe risk of aspiration.
The nurse in the maternity ward counsels a postpartum mother about the increased nutritional requirements during lactation. She explains the need for an additional 500 kcal/day and encourages intake of protein-rich foods, fluids, and green leafy vegetables. The nurse advises avoiding substances like alcohol and excessive caffeine that may alter breast milk composition. She uses a 24-hour dietary recall to tailor a culturally preferred meal plan. Education focuses on replenishing maternal stores with essential iron-rich and calcium-containing foods. Conversely, for children with celiac disease, the nurse provides detailed education on maintaining a strict gluten-free diet, avoiding wheat, barley, and rye. She monitors key health indicators such as growth parameters and stool consistency to evaluate the efficacy of the dietary therapy. 
For a community program focusing on undernourished children, the nurse uses the WHO growth chart to objectively assess malnutrition prevalence using measurements like weight-for-age. She designs a diet using nutrient-dense local foods and strongly promotes the complex practice of exclusive breastfeeding for the initial six months of life. The nurse coordinates follow-up visits to reinforce dietary counseling. In cardiac counseling, the nurse reinforces the DASH diet for patients with hyperlipidemia, guiding them toward stringent sodium restriction and emphasizing the need to replace saturated fats with healthy oils. Through motivational interviewing, she helps the patient set precise goals, such as limiting salt intake to 2 grams per day, thereby promoting preventive cardiology. 


Normal
The nurse performs a nutritional assessment (e.g., Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)) on a postoperative (post-op) patient with delayed wound healing (r/t poor perfusion). She evaluates weight history (% weight loss), intake, and functional capacity. Labs reveal low serum albumin (<3.5 g/dL) and hemoglobin (Hgb), indicating protein–energy malnutrition (PEM). Collaboration with the Registered Dietitian (RD) leads to a high-protein/high-calorie diet. In community health (CHN), the nurse fights micronutrient deficiencies (e.g., Vit. A, Iodine) and marasmus/kwashiorkor using the WHO growth chart (z-scores).

A nurse caring for a patient with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) applies therapeutic nutrition. This involves a carbohydrate-controlled diet (e.g., 45-60g/meal), emphasizing low-glycemic index (GI) foods. Patient education covers carb-counting and managing hyperglycemia / hypoglycemia. This (plus exercise) aims to lower HbA1c (7%) and prevent neuropathy / cardiovascular disease (CVD). For hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is key, reducing sodium (Na+) to 2,300mg and saturated fats (10% total kcal). The nurse monitors BP (130/80) and lipid profile (LDL-C).

For geriatric clients (in LTC), the nurse monitors for cachexia (wasting) and dehydration. Assessment includes Body Mass Index (BMI), skin turgor, and mucous membranes. For dysphagia (swallowing difficulty), the nurse implements the IDDSI (International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative) framework (Level 4 Pureed / Level 3 Moderately Thick) to prevent aspiration. She promotes high-fiber foods (for constipation) and Ca/Vit D (for osteoporosis). In severe deficits, she uses the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and monitors prealbumin / serum albumin (indicative of protein–energy malnutrition / PEM).
Hard
Managing a post-total gastrectomy patient (r/t gastric adenocarcinoma) requires advanced clinical nutrition. Due to risk of anastomotic leak, the patient may be NPO (nothing by mouth) and on Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). Transition to enteral feeding via a nasojejunal tube (NJT) (post-pyloric) is initiated cautiously. The nurse monitors for gastrointestinal (GIT) tolerance and aspiration pneumonia risk. Gradual progression to PO (oral) intake requires managing dumping syndrome (rapid hyperosmolar chyme entry into the jejunum), causing diaphoresis, tachycardia, and post-prandial hypoglycemia. Education for concurrent celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) requires a strict gluten-free diet (GFD).
In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the nurse manages Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) for a septic, NPO patient. This demands meticulous aseptic technique (re: CLABSI / Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection) for the PICC (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) or subclavian CVC. The nurse verifies the 3-in-1 (lipid/dextrose/amino-acid) solution and runs it via an infusion pump (e.g., 80mL/hr). Continuous monitoring (e.g., Q6H accu-checks) is vital to prevent metabolic derangements: hyperglycemia (target 140-180 mg/dL), hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and refeeding syndrome.
Managing a patient with pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy (e.g., FOLFIRINOX) presents profound nutritional challenges, including cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS). Oral intake is compromised by mucositis (oral ulcers) and dysgeusia (taste alteration). If enteral nutrition (EN) fails, Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is initiated via a CVC (e.g., port-a-cath). The nurse monitors for CLABSI (fever, chills) and metabolic complications: hyperglycemia (requiring insulin sliding scale / ISS), hypophosphatemia, and hypertriglyceridemia (from lipid emulsion). This pharmacologic-nutrition support is crucial for treatment tolerance.
A patient post-total gastrectomy (NPO > 5 days) with co-morbid Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is discharged on enteral nutrition (EN) via a jejunostomy tube (J-tube). The nurse must be educated on recognizing dumping syndrome (early vs. late / alimentary hypoglycemia), requiring small, low-carbohydrate, high-protein/fat boluses. Managing glycemic control is complex; the EN formula (e.g., 1.5 kcal/mL) provides continuous CHO, requiring a basal-bolus insulin regimen (e.g., Lantus + Humalog) adjusted for the EN rate (mL/hr) and potential hypoglycemia from dumping syndrome. This requires meticulous intake/output (I&O) and frequent blood glucose monitoring (BGM).
Maternal and Child Nursing
Easy 
The nurse conducts a vital family planning education session, discussing various complex contraceptive methods including natural family planning, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and injectables. She uses anatomical models to explain correct usage and addresses sensitive misconceptions about fertility. Counseling promotes informed choices based on health conditions, preferences, and religious beliefs. This role supports responsible parenthood. In the well-baby clinic, the nurse performs growth monitoring using specific tools like a length board and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) tape. Results are plotted on the WHO growth chart to identify growth deviations like undernutrition or stunting. She educates parents on immunization schedules, weaning practices, and developmental milestones. 
In managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the nurse educates the patient on the necessity of maintaining tight glycemic control to prevent complications like macrosomia. She monitors blood sugar using capillary blood glucose monitoring and reinforces adherence to the low-glycemic index meal plan. Fetal surveillance procedures, such as non-stress tests (NST) and ultrasound, are monitored closely. The nurse provides significant emotional support to reduce anxiety. In the school setting, the nurse implements a comprehensive adolescent health program focusing on complex issues like reproductive health education and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). She conducts screenings for issues like anemia, malnutrition, and depression to promote holistic development. 
A school health nurse focuses on adolescent wellness through specialized programs. She conducts group discussions on complex topics like puberty, menstrual hygiene, and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The nurse creates a nonjudgmental environment and provides screenings for underlying issues such as malnutrition and depression. This program promotes self-awareness and health consciousness. In labor and delivery, the nurse meticulously monitors the fetal heart rate using a Doppler device and provides comfort measures such as breathing exercises. The critical tracking of labor dynamics is recorded in the partograph, documenting cervical dilation and uterine contraction patterns. This detailed intrapartum nursing care supports a safe birthing process.
Normal
In the antenatal clinic, the nurse cares for a primigravida (G1P0) at 20 weeks Age of Gestation (AOG). The prenatal assessment includes fundal height measurement (at umbilicus) and fetal heart tone (FHT) auscultation (rate 120-160 bpm). BP monitoring (baseline 140/90 mmHg) detects preeclampsia (HTN, proteinuria, edema). The nurse follows the Focused Antenatal Care (FANC) approach. During labor, the nurse uses Leopold’s maneuvers (LMs) to determine fetal position/lie. She documents progress in the partograph, tracking cervical effacement / dilation, fetal station (-5 to +5), and uterine contractions (UCs).
During the first stage of labor (latent/active phase), the nurse assesses progression by checking cervical dilation (0-10cm), effacement, and fetal station. A Doppler monitors the fetal heart rate (FHR) for bradycardia (<110) or tachycardia (>160). Comfort measures include breathing exercises. Documentation is rigorously performed in the partograph. If postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (Estimated Blood Loss / EBL > 500mL) occurs, a boggy (atonic) uterus triggers immediate uterine massage and Oxytocin (Pitocin) infusion (may add Methergine if BP is stable). This is a life-threatening obstetric emergency.
When caring for a patient with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), the nurse must manage dehydration / hypovolemia (e.g., sunken fontanelles, poor turgor). She implements oral rehydration therapy (ORT) For a postpartum mother, the priority is hemorrhage prevention, assessing lochia (rubra/serosa/alba) and uterine involution (fundal height). Managing PPH (atonic uterus) necessitates Oxytocin infusion. Immediate newborn care mandates APGAR scoring (at 1 & 5 min) and thermoregulation via skin-to-skin contact (SSC) per the ENC (Essential Newborn Care) protocol.
Hard
Following delivery, the nurse executes the Essential Newborn Care (ENC) protocol. This includes APGAR scoring (Score 0-10) at 1/5 minutes, assessing Heart Rate (>100), Respiratory Effort (cry), Muscle Tone (flexion), Reflex Irritability (grimace), and Color (acrocyanosis).prevent hypothermia (cold stress). prophylactic medications administered: Vitamin K (Phytomenadione) 1mg IM (vastus lateralis) to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN) and Erythromycin 0.5% eye ointment to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum (r/t N. gonorrhoeae / C. trachomatis). This ensures transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life.

In the postpartum unit, the nurse monitors for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (EBL > 500mL / 1000mL C/S) assessing for a boggy (atonic) uterus. immediate uterine massage. Oxytocin infusion (e.g., 20 IU in 1L NSS) (or Carboprost, Methergine). In the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit), the nurse cares for a premature (preterm) infant (30 weeks AOG). incubator for thermo regulation monitored for apnea of prematurity (AOP) and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) requiring caffeine citrate (loading dose 20mg/kg) and potential surfactant therapy.
A pediatric nurse managing acute gastroenteritis (AGE) prioritizes managing hypovolemic dehydration (and metabolic acidosis)  (e.g., sunken fontanelles, capillary refill > 3 sec). oral rehydration therapy (ORT)  prevents nosocomial (hospital-acquired) transmission.monitors gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diagnosed via 100g OGTT)performs capillary blood glucose (CBG) monitoring (target <95mg/dL fasting). Fetal well-being is assessed using non-stress tests (NSTs) and biophysical profiles (BPPs) to prevent macrosomia (EFW > 4000g) and subsequent neonatal hypoglycemia (BG < 40mg/dL).
Nursing Ethics
Easy
Ethical nursing practice begins with adherence to the five rights of medication administration. When a patient refuses an antibiotic, citing a previous allergy reaction, the nurse demonstrates profound respect for patient autonomy. She immediately stops the procedure, verifies the allergy record, and reports the concern to the physician. Documenting the refusal upholds legal and ethical responsibilities. This highlights the importance of obtaining informed consent, ensuring patient participation is central to care. Another key principle is justice, requiring the nurse to provide equal treatment regardless of financial status or social background. Prioritization of care must be based strictly on clinical urgency, not preference, demonstrating ethical discernment by balancing compassion with impartial clinical judgment. 
Upholding the integrity of the profession sometimes demands moral courage. If a nurse observes a colleague recording vital signs that were not actually taken, she must discretely confirm the inaccuracy and report the incident to her supervisor following the chain of command. This action reflects the necessity of accountability and truthfulness, protecting patients from potential harm. The nurse's commitment to reporting unethical conduct maintains the integrity of the system. Conversely, the principle of respect for patient autonomy dictates that if a patient refuses a medication, the nurse must honor that decision, verify allergies, and seek an alternative prescription. By ensuring informed consent and respecting patient choice, the nurse maintains ethical and legal standards. 
If a patient from an indigenous community requires a cultural ritual before a medical event, the nurse ensures that this practice is allowed, provided it poses no harm. By coordinating with the physician and ensuring privacy, the nurse demonstrates respect for cultural diversity and upholds the principle of autonomy. This promotes holistic, culturally appropriate care. Similarly, the duty of non-maleficence requires extreme vigilance during surgical procedures. Calling out a break in aseptic technique is a display of moral courage and professional integrity. Prioritizing the sterility of the surgical field prevents potential hospital-acquired infections and complications, proving that ethical nursing is inherently protective. 
Normal
If a sentinel event occurs, such as administering 10-units Humalog (lispro) instead of 10-units Lantus (glargine), the nurse’s. corrective action monitors the patient’s health (e.g., CBG Q15-min), initiates the hypoglycemia protocol (e.g., D50W IVP), and reports via the hospital’s adverse event reporting system (AERS). This exemplifies veracity (truth-telling) and non-maleficence. In end-of-life (EOL) care a patient (with metastatic CA) wishes to enact their DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Intubate) status, the nurse advocates arranging a palliative/hospice consultation.

Preventing harm (non-maleficence). In the Operating Room (OR), if a nurse (e.g., the circulator) notices a breach of sterility (e.g., a laparotomy sponge dropped < 1-inch border), she must immediately replace the sterile field. This moral courage prevents iatrogenic / nosocomial (Surgical Site Infection / SSI) complications. When allocating scarce resources (ICU beds), distributive justice dictates that indigent or non-compliant patients receive equal care. Triage (using ESI / Emergency Severity Index) must be based on acuity, not socio-economic status (SES).
The principle of veracity mandates truth-telling, (post-medication error). Reporting the incident (wrong-route administration) via the AERS (adverse event reporting system) and maintaining transparency to non-maleficence (do no harm). The nurse must ensure justice (distributive justice), delivering impartial care based on clinical acuity (triage) rather than external factors (financial status, insurance-type, or VIP-status). This requires constant ethical discernment to prevent discrimination.
Hard
The nurse faces complex ethical dilemmas, such as paternalistic family requests to conceal a terminal prognosis (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) from a patient (who has decisional capacity). Guided by veracity and autonomy (the patient’s right to self-determination), the nurse consults the interdisciplinary team (IDT) and the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC).honesty (delivered with profound empathy) serves the patient’s best interest (beneficence). If a patient insists on a culturally-specific ritual (e.g., shamanistic-healing) before an emergent-procedure (e.g., C-section), the nurse ensures the ritual is non-harmful (e.g., no contra-indicated substances) and provides privacy. This cultural-congruence (Leininger) upholds autonomy.

Ethical leadership (e.g., transformational leadership) is critical. A nurse supervisor mediates intradepartmental conflicts, reinforcing the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses (e.g., Provision 6 - moral environment). She manages moral distress (the "crescendo effect") among subordinates by providing confidential counseling (e.g., EAP / Employee Assistance Program) and facilitating ethical reflection during CISD (Critical Incident Stress Debriefing). In end-of-life (EOL) care, the nurse advocates to cease futility-of-care (e.g., experimental-chemotherapy). This duty of beneficence (doing good) vs. non-maleficence (avoiding harm) requires a transition to a palliative-consult (focused on symptom-management / QoL).
Navigating the ethical landscape of concealing a prognosis (e.g., metastatic pancreatic cancer) requires Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) consultation. The decision to prioritize veracity and the patient’s autonomy (right to informed-consent / refusal) often supersedes familial paternalism. communication must be done with empathy (Watson's Caritas). In leadership, the supervisor addresses moral distress (e.g., regarding futility-of-care) and ensures the workplace is guided by the ANA Code of Ethics (Provision 1 - dignity; Provision 5 - duty to self), fostering a culture of psychological-safety and integrity.
Hard 4 (Revised P10)
When a nurse acts as an advocate for a patient (with end-stage COPD / Stage IV CA) requesting cessation of life-sustaining treatment (LST). She upholds autonomy (self-determination) and dignity. Ensuring a transition to palliative care (focused on symptom-management / QoL) aligns with beneficence. If a colleague fabricates/falsifies VS (e.g., "charting by exception" incorrectly) or diverts narcotics (e.g., fentanyl), the nurse must use moral courage to report the conduct (via chain-of-command / risk-management). This enforces accountability and veracity, protecting the integrity of the legal record (which is discoverable in litigation).

Medical and Surgical Nursing
Easy
Caring for a patient with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and poor wound healing requires a holistic approach. The nurse assesses the wound meticulously for color, drainage, odor, and size, employing strict aseptic technique during dressing changes. Blood glucose monitoring is performed frequently. Crucial education focuses on adherence to glycemic control and detailed foot care. Collaboration with the physician and nutritionist ensures a comprehensive care plan. In perioperative care, preparing a patient for appendectomy involves ensuring informed consent is signed and verifying that the patient has been fasting for at least eight hours. Postoperatively, the nurse monitors for signs of severe infection, such as fever or purulent drainage, documenting vital signs regularly. 
In the event of suspected hypovolemic shock, the nurse’s priority is rapid, life-saving intervention. After recognizing signs like a rapid pulse and low blood pressure, she calls for assistance, places the patient supine with elevated legs, and initiates oxygen therapy. She confirms that IV fluids are running as ordered and notifies the physician immediately. This critical thinking prevents further deterioration. When preparing a patient for surgery, the nurse ensures the patient understands pre-op requirements and provides crucial teaching on post-operative management, including deep breathing, coughing exercises, and pain management using the numeric pain scale. Competence in perioperative care ensures patient safety throughout the surgical journey. 
Managing a new colostomy requires specialized nursing education. The nurse teaches the patient proper stoma care, including managing the ostomy bag and recognizing signs of irritation or infection. Providing emotional support is essential to address the complex body image concerns following major surgical alteration. For the diabetic patient, adherence to glycemic control is key for wound healing. The nurse monitors blood glucose and provides education on preventive measures like meticulous foot care to prevent severe complications such as diabetic neuropathy and infection. Regular wound assessment using aseptic technique ensures clean and safe dressing changes. 
Normal
The nurse prepares a post-laparotomy patient for early ambulation. She confirms the order, checks VS (vital signs), and ensures the PIV (peripheral IV) is secured. Education is provided on preventing iatrogenic complications: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (using SCDs - sequential compression devices), atelectasis (using an incentive spirometer / IS), and paralytic ileus. In the medical ward, the nurse monitors congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is on furosemide (Lasix) therapy, requiring strict I&O (intake/output) monitoring for diuresis. She tracks serum potassium (K+) levels to detect hypokalemia (K+ < 3.5 mEq/L), which can cause fatal dysrhythmias.
For a patient with decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) on furosemide (Lasix), vigilance is crucial. She checks for anasarca (severe generalized edema) and monitors serum potassium (K+) for hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L) to mitigate arrhythmia risk. In respiratory care for COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), management includes administering bronchodilators (e.g., Albuterol) via nebulizer or MDI (metered-dose inhaler) and teaching pursed-lip breathing. Positioning the patient in high Fowler’s (HOB > 60 degrees) maximizes lung expansion, preventing hypercapnia (retained CO2) and acute respiratory distress.
Continuous management of hypertension (HTN) involves administering antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers like Metoprolol) and monitoring BP trends (goal 130/80 mmHg). The nurse checks for orthostatic hypotension and reinforces adherence to low-sodium diets (Na+ 2,300mg) to prevent CVA/MI. When performing hemodialysis (HD), the nurse assesses the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for patency (a palpable thrill / audible bruit). She monitors for intradialytic complications (disequilibrium syndrome) and documents pre/post BUN/Creatinine levels and total fluid (kg) removed.



Hard
A nurse managing a COPD exacerbation (AECOPD) performs continuous respiratory assessments. She observes for tripod positioning and accessory muscle use (e.g., sternocleidomastoid retractions). Auscultation reveals diminished sounds or expiratory wheezes. Pulse oximetry (SpO2 < 90% on 2L NC) and ABGs (Arterial Blood Gases) (showing respiratory acidosis, pH < 7.35, PaCO2 > 45) guide therapy. Interventions include bronchodilators (e.g., Ipratropium), systemic corticosteroids (e.g., Solu-Medrol), and potential BIPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) initiation to manage the pathophysiology of gas exchange impairment.
A nurse manages a patient in hypertensive urgency/emergency (BP > 180/120 mmHg). She assesses for end-organ damage (e.g., encephalopathy, nephropathy). The nurse administers the pharmacotherapeutic regimen (e.g., IV Labetalol, Nitroprusside). If a post-op (postoperative) patient becomes diaphoretic, pale, with tachycardia (HR > 120) and hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg), she suspects hemorrhagic (hypovolemic) shock. She initiates the RRT (Rapid Response Team), places the patient in Trendelenburg, starts O2 (10L via non-rebreather mask), and prepares for massive transfusion protocol (MTP) with IV crystalloids (0.9% NaCl).
A patient with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requires rapid intervention. The nurse assesses tachypnea (RR > 24), hypoxemia (SpO2 < 92%), and auscultates for adventitious sounds (e.g., inspiratory crackles, rhonchi). Interventions include obtaining sputum C&S (Culture & Sensitivity), administering broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., Ceftriaxone), encouraging incentive spirometry (IS) (e.g., 10x/hr), and performing chest physiotherapy (CPT) / postural drainage. In End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), the nurse performs the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) patency check (palpable thrill / audible bruit) before initiating hemodialysis.
The care of a patient with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) involves specialized monitoring. The nurse assesses the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) patency (a palpable thrill and audible bruit) and verifies pre-dialysis labs (BUN, Creatinine, K+). During hemodialysis (HD), she observes for intradialytic hypotension or osmotic disequilibrium syndrome. In surgical recovery (e.g., post-hemicolectomy), managing a new colostomy/ileostomy involves inspecting the stoma (must be "beefy-red") and peristomal skin integrity. Education covers effluent management and addressing psychosocial body image concerns.
Psychiatric Nursing
Easy 
When a patient experiences a panic disorder attack (manifested by shortness of breath, chest tightness, and trembling), the nurse remains present, offering reassurance and guiding slow, deep breathing. She utilizes grounding techniques to refocus the patient on the present environment. Vital signs are monitored to rule out acute cardiac complications. Once the panic subsides, the nurse teaches cognitive-behavioral strategies for coping. For patients demonstrating aggressive behavior due to conditions like intermittent explosive disorder, the nurse maintains safety, uses de-escalation techniques, and, if necessary, applies chemical restraints following strict institutional policy. Afterward, a debriefing session facilitates the exploration of alternative coping methods. 
When a patient with PTSD experiences flashbacks or hypervigilance, the nurse ensures the environment is quiet and secure. She supports the use of grounding exercises and helps the patient identify trauma triggers. Active listening and validating the patient’s experiences are crucial components of therapeutic interaction. Collaboration ensures referral to psychotherapy and medication adherence to SSRIs. For obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the nurse gradually limits ritual time, supporting the patient with behavioral therapy and focusing on adherence to prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The goal is to reduce ritual frequency and associated anxiety levels. 
For a patient recovering from substance use disorder, the nurse utilizes motivational interviewing to assess the patient’s readiness for change. She provides education on the physiological effects of drugs, relapse prevention strategies, and the importance of support systems. Coordination with a multidisciplinary team, including social workers and counselors, is crucial. Encouraging attendance at support groups like Narcotics Anonymous and periodic urine drug screening promotes accountability. For a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibiting repeated handwashing, the nurse gradually limits the time allowed for the compulsive behavior. She supports behavioral therapy and reinforces medication adherence to SSRIs. 
Medium
A nurse caring for a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD) establishes rapport. (e.g., assessing for anhedonia or avolition). She uses active listening and empathy. A critical intervention is assessing for suicidal ideation (SI) / homicidal ideation (HI) by asking direct questions. Environmental safety (e.g., 1:1 observation, ligature-risk removal) must be implemented. The nurse monitors SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine) and watches for serotonin syndrome (e.g., mental status changes, hyperreflexia, fever >38 degrees C). For patients with schizophrenia (e.g., positive symptoms) experiencing auditory hallucinations (AH), the nurse uses reality-testing.
A nurse facilitates group therapy (a form of milieu therapy) for patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).  Non-pharmacologic interventions (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), guided imagery, mindfulness-based stress reduction / MBSR). In cases of schizophrenia (e.g., paranoid-type), the nurse monitors adherence to atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone) and observes for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as acute dystonia (muscle spasms), akathisia (restlessness), or pseudoparkinsonism (rigidity/tremors).
Managing complex substance use disorder (SUD) involves using motivational interviewing (MI) to explore ambivalence (using the CAGE or CIWA-Ar assessment). The nurse provides education on relapse prevention (HALT - Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) and coordinates with the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Encouraging Narcotics Anonymous (NA) attendance and monitoring via urine drug screening (UDS). When facilitating group therapy for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). introduces non-pharmacologic interventions like progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and guided imagery. Her role ensures evaluation within the therapeutic milieu.
Hard
In managing a patient in a manic episode (re: Bipolar I Disorder / BP-I), the nurse observes psychomotor agitation, pressured speech, flight of ideas (FOI), clang associations, and grandiosity. She provides a low-stimulation (low-stim) environment. She administers mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium carbonate) and crucially monitors serum lithium levels (therapeutic range: 0.8-1.2 mEq/L; toxicity > 1.5 mEq/L). Managing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) requires managing hypervigilance and medication adherence (e.g., anxiolytics like clonazepam or SSRIs like sertraline).
The nurse managing an adolescent with anorexia nervosa (AN) records daily weight (e.g., blind-weights), intake (% consumed), and Body Mass Index (BMI) (e.g., < 17.5 kg/m²). Vigilant monitoring is required for serious physiologic sequelae: bradycardia (HR < 60), hypotension, electrolyte imbalance (e.g., hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia), amenorrhea, and lanugo (fine body hair).  (re: intermittent explosive disorder / IED), the nurse employs de-escalation. If chemical restraints (e.g., 5mg IM olanzapine STAT) or seclusion are used, 1:1 monitoring is mandatory. (a post-episode debriefing).
In dealing with auditory hallucinations (AH) in schizophrenia (e.g., paranoid-type), the nurse redirects (e.g., "command hallucinations" require 1:1 observation). Monitoring for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) is essential when administering first-generation antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol). The nurse must also assess for tardive dyskinesia (TD) (irreversible) and life-threatening Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) (e.g., fever, rigidity, autonomic dysfunction). For Bipolar I (BP-I) mania, (e.g., lithium carbonate) necessitates monitoring serum levels (e.g., toxicity > 1.5 mEq/L, presenting as coarse tremors, ataxia, confusion).

A patient admitted for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (w/ psychotic features) requires constant suicidal ideation (SI) assessment and ligature-risk environmental safety. The nurse must monitor for adverse effects (e.g., serotonin syndrome - hyperthermia, clonus, hyperreflexia) associated with SSRIs / SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine). For the co-morbid adolescent with anorexia nervosa (AN), the nurse (tracking BMI < 17.5 kg/m²) and monitoring for physiologic decompensation: bradycardia (HR < 50), hypotension, and electrolyte imbalance (e.g., hypokalemia < 3.0 mEq/L, risking cardiac arrhythmias). The nurse must also prevent refeeding syndrome.




Nursing Research


Easy
A nurse researcher investigating a high incidence of pressure injuries formulates a complex research problem: evaluating the effectiveness of a structured turning schedule protocol in preventing pressure ulcers. A quantitative descriptive design is chosen to collect measurable data. Using purposive sampling, 30 bedridden patients are selected. The nurse develops a structured observation checklist and ensures its technical validity and reliability through expert review and pilot testing. After intervention, data are analyzed using statistical software to determine the reduction in ulcer cases. The findings support evidence-based nursing interventions and lead to recommendations for hospital-wide adoption. This process translates empirical data into practice improvements. 
A researcher investigates the complex relationship between workload and job stress among ICU nurses. She uses a correlational research design to determine the association between these two variables. A technically validated Likert-scale questionnaire measures perceived workload and stress levels, distributed via random sampling to ensure representativeness. Strict adherence to informed consent and confidentiality upholds ethical standards. Data analysis employs Pearson’s correlation coefficient, revealing a strong positive relationship between workload intensity and stress. Results guide complex recommendations for adjusting staffing ratios and implementing mental health programs. This research uses empirical data to influence organizational policies and improve the well-being of healthcare professionals. 
Evaluating the effectiveness of telehealth consultations in managing hypertensive patients during a crisis requires a descriptive-comparative design. The study compares adherence rates and blood pressure control between telehealth users and traditional clinic patients. Data collection incorporates electronic records and patient satisfaction surveys. Interpretation uses descriptive statistics and often proposes integrating telehealth into future care plans. This research highlights data-driven decision-making. In acute care, implementing a turning schedule protocol requires a quantitative descriptive design and the collection of measurable incidence rates before and after implementation. The utilization of purposive sampling ensures the focus on the vulnerable bedridden patients. 
Normal
A nurse researcher designs an evidence-based practice (EBP) project focused on the reduction of medication errors.The process involves a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) (e.g., Fishbone diagram) and implementing a double-check verification system for high-risk drugs (heparin, insulin). Data (collected pre/post-implementation) demonstrate a significant decline in errors (e.g., 40% reduction).This illustrates the integration of research, Quality Improvement (QI), and clinical leadership. Another nurse might use a mixed-methods design (e.g., convergent parallel) combining quantitative (quan) anxiety scale scores (e.g., GAD-7) with qualitative (qual) patient feedback.
When conducting a cross-sectional survey on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) practices, the nurse employs random sampling. Results might indicate gaps in compliance (barrier = 45% "time constraints"). Based on these findings (resource allocation). For qualitative (qual) research, achieving trustworthiness (rigor) is vital, often requiring member checking (participant validation). This phenomenological research (based on Heidegger's philosophy) provides a deeper understanding of patient coping mechanisms, informing person-centered nursing interventions.
The evidence-based practice (EBP) project to reduce medication errors requires a systematic Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, including a formal Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Implementing a double-check verification system. Dissemination facilitates policy change. This demonstrates the interconnectedness of research and Quality Improvement (QI). A qualitative study (ethnography) exploring the "lived experiences" relies on thematic analysis of transcripts (transcribed verbatim). The nurse ensures trustworthiness (rigor) through techniques like triangulation (e.g., using multiple data sources).
Hard
To evaluate the efficacy of health education, a nurse employs a rigorous quasi-experimental design (e.g., non-equivalent control group, pretest-posttest). Participants (N=50, convenience sample) receive weekly education. Data collection.Results (e.g., improved HbA1c, p < 0.05) confirm the vital role. Another nurse may conduct a systematic review / meta-analysis (e.g., following PRISMA guidelines) in databases (e.g., PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library). The quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis), (e.g., calculating a pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI)).
A nurse explores the "lived experience" (phenomenon) of cancer survivors using qualitative phenomenological research (e.g., Husserlian / descriptive epistemology). She conducts in-depth, semi-structured interviews. (N=10) until data saturation is reached. Audio recordings are transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis (e.g., Braun & Clarke's 6-steps). Trustworthiness (rigor) (e.g., Guba & Lincoln's criteria: credibility, transferability) through member checking (participant validation), triangulation, and reflexivity (maintaining a bracketed journal).
A nurse educator conducts a true experimental design (specifically a Randomized Controlled Trial / RCT) Students are randomly assigned (randomization) to a control (lecture) or experimental (simulation) group (N=100). Pretest/posttest measure skill acquisition. Statistical analysis (e.g., independent samples t-test or ANOVA) reveals a significant difference (p < 0.01) Results are disseminated (e.g., IRB approval #12345). Furthermore, a systematic review (e.g., answering a PICO question) requires selecting studies using strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and appraising methodological quality (e.g., using the CASP critical appraisal checklist).

To influence organizational policy, correlational research is effective. Analyzing workload (X-variable) and job stress (Y-variable) using Pearson’s r (correlation coefficient) reveals empirical support (e.g., r = +0.78, p < 0.001), (requires IRB approval). For educational advancement, a true experimental design (RCT) requires the use of pretest/posttest performance assessments. Findings (e.g., t(48) = 4.15, p < 0.05) analyzed by t-tests (or ANCOVA to control for pretest scores) are crucial for competency-based learning.
Critical Care Nursing

Easy
In the coronary care unit, managing a patient with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) requires immediate action. The nurse initiates oxygen therapy and performs continuous ECG monitoring, administering medications like nitroglycerin and morphine sulfate. Vital signs are checked frequently to detect arrhythmias or hypotension. Key to diagnosis is monitoring serum cardiac biomarkers, specifically troponin and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). The nurse ensures emergency resuscitation equipment is accessible for potential cardiac arrest and defibrillation. If a patient presents in hypovolemic shock, the nurse immediately initiates a large-bore intravenous line and administers isotonic crystalloids, such as normal saline, prioritizing fluid resuscitation. 
In the cardiac unit, managing congestive heart failure (CHF) requires strict intake and output (I&O) monitoring and daily weight assessment. The nurse monitors for signs of fluid overload, such as pulmonary crackles, while titrating dopamine infusion. Electrolyte imbalances are common, requiring regular checks of potassium and sodium. For a patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) receiving hemodialysis, the nurse checks the AV fistula for a thrill and bruit. Pre- and post-dialysis weights are recorded, and monitoring for acute complications like hypotension and muscle cramps is ongoing. Education emphasizes strict fluid restriction and dietary control. 
For a severe trauma patient, the nurse initiates the ABCDE approach: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure. Large-bore IV lines are inserted for immediate fluid replacement and potential blood transfusion. The nurse manages external hemorrhage using pressure dressings and vigilantly monitors vital signs for indications of hypovolemic shock. Pain is managed with IV analgesics while maintaining hemodynamic stability. This rapid, organized response exemplifies critical judgment. In managing AMI, continuous ECG monitoring detects dysrhythmias, and the nurse monitors serum cardiac biomarkers like troponin to evaluate the extent of myocardial injury. The presence of a crash cart ensures readiness for defibrillation. 
Normal
Upon receiving a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the ICU nurse prioritizes the ABCs. The patient is on mechanical ventilation (e.g., AC/VC mode), requiring verification of endotracheal tube (ETT) placement. The nurse adjusts ventilator settings (e.g., FiO_2 60% / PEEP 10 cm H_2O) to optimize oxygenation (target SpO_2 > 90%). Arterial blood gases (ABG) are monitored for hypoxemia / hypercapnia. Suctioning (sterile-technique) prevents hypoxia and rigorous oral care (chlorhexidine) every 2 hours prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This prevents complications like barotrauma (e.g., pneumothorax).

A nurse managing a post-craniotomy patient must control intracranial pressure (ICP) (target < 20 mmHg). She elevates the HOB 30 degrees and maintains eucapnia (PCO_2 35-40 mmHg), as hypercapnia causes cerebral vasodilation. Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) is maintained (CPP = MAP - ICP). The osmotic diuretic Mannitol (monitoring serum osmolality). In the cardiac ICU (CICU), managing decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) requires monitoring for jugular vein distension (JVD) and pulmonary edema (e.g., bibasilar crackles). The nurse titrates inotropes / vasopressors (e.g., Dopamine / Dobutamine) (e.g., K+ < 3.5 mEq/L) due to furosemide therapy.

For a patient with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE), the nurse monitors anticoagulation therapy (Heparin infusion) for signs of bleeding (e.g., hematuria, melena) monitoring aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time). Oxygen therapy (10L via non-rebreather) corrects hypoxemia. Continuous ECG monitoring detects tachycardia (Sinus Tach) or arrhythmias (monitoring PT/INR for Warfarin (Coumadin)). In post-cardiac arrest (ROSC) care, the nurse implements Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) maintaining core temperature (32 degrees C-36 degrees C) to preserve neurological function.
Hard
For a patient in hypovolemic (hemorrhagic) shock, the nurse must rapidly stabilize hemodynamics. She starts two large-bore (14g/16g) IVs, administering isotonic crystalloids (e.g., 0.9% NaCl) (3:1 ratio) or colloids (e.g., Albumin) / blood products (PRBCs) (1:1:1 ratio) drawing labs for CBC (Hgb/Hct), serum lactate (goal: clearance > 10%), and type/crossmatch. A Foley catheter measures oliguria (output < 0.5 mL/kg/hr) monitoring CVP (Central Venous Pressure) / PAWP (Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure). In neuro-intensive care (e.g., post-TBI / Traumatic Brain Injury), a GCS < 8 (coma) (monitoring for Cushing's Triad). HOB 30 degrees to prevent increased ICP (>20 mmHg).
A trauma patient with flail chest (multiple rib fractures) requires stabilization, monitoring for paradoxical chest movement and hemopneumothorax. The nurse assists with intubation (ETT placement) for mechanical ventilation (e.g., ARDSNet protocol, low tidal volume / V_t 4-6 mL/kg) and manages chest tubes. For septic shock (e.g., qSOFA > 2), Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) is initiated: broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., Vancomycin + Piperacillin-Tazobactam) post-blood cultures, and vasopressor support (e.g., Norepinephrine / Levophed) to maintain MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) > 65 mmHg (e.g., serum lactate > 2 mmol/L).
Managing septic shock involves the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 1-hour bundle: titrating vasopressors (e.g., Norepinephrine + Vasopressin) to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg monitoring lactate / procalcitonin. Strict aseptic technique manages central venous catheters (CVCs). (to prevent CLABSI). In the case of acute kidney injury (AKI) (per RIFLE/AKIN criteria) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), the nurse assesses the AV (arteriovenous) fistula (thrill/bruit) monitoring for intradialytic complications (e.g., hypotension, disequilibrium syndrome) during IHD (Intermittent Hemodialysis) or CRRT (Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy).
During Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) (post-ROSC) the nurse monitors cardiac rhythm (risk: bradycardia, K+ shifts). Sedatives (e.g., Propofol) and neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) (e.g., Cisatracurium) prevent shivering. Rewarming must be gradual (e.g., 0.25 Degrees C/hr). Continuous EEG monitors for subclinical seizures. When managing refractory ARDS. The nurse monitors P_{plat} (plateau pressure < 30 cm H_2O) and PaO_2/FiO_2 ratio (<100). (e.g., V_t 4-6 mL/kg), prone positioning (16+ hrs/day), or initiation of V-V ECMO (Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation).
Disaster Nursing
Easy
Following a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, the nurse assists in setting up an emergency field hospital with decontamination zones. She provides immediate care, including fluid resuscitation for patients with fractures. Crucially, she offers Psychological First Aid (PFA) to survivors exhibiting shock and anxiety. Vigilance is required to monitor for signs of the dangerous crush syndrome and potential acute renal failure. Amidst an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in an evacuation camp, the nurse initiates stringent infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. She conducts health surveillance, meticulously recording new cases. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are distributed, and severe cases are referred for IV therapy.
When managing an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in an evacuation camp, the nurse's priority is IPC. She conducts precise health surveillance to identify transmission patterns. Distribution of Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) and referral for IV therapy manage dehydration. Collaboration with public health authorities ensures water testing and disinfection. In the post-disaster rehabilitation phase, the nurse implements livelihood programs, nutrition education, and mental health counseling. She uses evaluation tools to measure the impact of interventions and assess community resilience, underscoring the holistic role of nursing in promoting sustainable recovery. 
In preparedness efforts for a major storm, the nurse leads the DRRM (Disaster Risk Reduction and Management) team. She identifies vulnerable groups and collaborates with LGUs to ensure evacuation centers have medical supplies and proper sanitation facilities. Post-disaster, she conducts a rapid damage assessment and needs analysis. For patients exposed to volcanic ash, the nurse focuses on respiratory protection, distributing face masks and assessing conditions like asthma exacerbations. She maintains the evacuee health registry and provides education on minimizing exposure by staying indoors.

She conducts a hazard vulnerability assessment (HVA). Coordination with local government units (LGUs). After landfall, the nurse participates in a rapid needs assessment (RNA). Following a mass casualty incident (MCI), the nurse uses the START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) system (RPM Respirations <30, Perfusion <2 sec, Mental Status "Can do"). Red-tag (Immediate) patients ( airway compromise) receive attention, while Green-tag (Minor).
In a mass casualty incident (MCI) scenario, the nurse implements the START triage system. Victims with airway obstruction or hemorrhage receive immediate (Red tag) attention. The nurse performs Basic Life Support (BLS) (C-A-B, tourniquet application for hemorrhage control). In the aftermath of an earthquake.She provides care for crush injuries and monitors for crush syndrome (rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia), preparing for acute renal failure (ARF) and potential dialysis.
In a flooded community, the nurse provides care for leptospirosis (r/t L. interrogans) and cellulitis. She implements mass prophylaxis using Doxycycline (e.g., 200mg PO x1) per DOH protocol. Medical missions provide Tetanus Toxoid (TT) immunization. During a pandemic (e.g., COVID-19), the nurse enforces IPC protocols (e.g., precise donning/doffing of PPE / N95 / PAPR) and implements airborne/droplet precautions. She participates in contact tracing (CI/CT) and coordinates vaccination campaigns (e.g., 90% target) with BHWs (Barangay Health Workers).
Hard
When assigned to a HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials) / CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive) operation (e.g., Level A/B PPE). She performs critical decontamination (e.g., dilution, isolation, emulsification) by flushing exposed skin. Victims are categorized in a safe "Cold Zone" (e.g., >100m upwind/uphill). She coordinates with toxicologists for antidote administration (e.g., Atropine / Pralidoxime (2-PAM) via ATNAA / MARK I Kit for organophosphate exposure). During a volcanic eruption (pyroclastic flow) assessing for silicosis and SO_2 / H_2S (e.g., IDLH - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) exposure.
A nurse in a radiological emergency (e.g., RDD / "Dirty Bomb") must screen victims (in the Warm Zone) for radiation exposure (contamination) using a Geiger-Müller counter (measuring mSv/hr).The nurse administers potassium iodide (KI) (e.g., 130mg PO) to block thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine (I-131) and monitors for Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) (e.g., hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, neurovascular syndromes) if exposure > 1 Sv (100 rem). Meticulous documentation (e.g., dosimetry readings) is critical.
During a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI), the nurse must maintain rapid, ethical triage using the START system (e.g., RPM: R>30 = Red; P>2 = Red; M=Can't follow = Red). (e.g., hemorrhage control via tourniquet / hemostatic agents). In a chemical plant explosion (HAZMAT) wearing Level A/B PPE (per HAZWOPER) performs decontamination. Victims are treated in the Cold Zone. (e.g., organophosphate / nerve agent exposure, presenting with cholinergic crisis - SLUDGEM: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, GI distress, Emesis, Miosis) coordinating for antidote administration (e.g., ATNAA / DuoDote).
When assisting in radiological emergency response (e.g., nuclear-plant meltdown), the nurse uses a Geiger-Müller counter. The administration of potassium iodide (KI) (130mg PO) is a critical prophylactic measure (for I-131). The nurse vigilantly monitors for the prodromal phase (e.g., N/V/D) of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS). During post-disaster recovery (e.g., post-flood), the nurse addresses zoonotic / vector-borne diseases like Leptospirosis (r/t L. interrogans), implementing mass prophylaxis with Doxycycline (200mg/week) and organizing Tetanus (Td/Tdap) immunization.

Emergency Nursing
Easy
A severely hypoglycemic patient, unconscious with a blood glucose level of 36 mg/dL, requires immediate intervention. The nurse administers 50% dextrose intravenously as ordered and rapidly reassesses responsiveness. Continuous monitoring of glucose levels and vital signs is essential. This swift action prevents hypoglycemic coma and potential brain injury. For a patient with a deep laceration and active bleeding, the nurse applies direct pressure with sterile gauze to control hemorrhage. She assesses distal pulses to ensure circulation, verifies Tetanus immunization status, and cleanses the wound using aseptic technique prior to suturing. 
In managing a worker with a deep laceration, the nurse's priority is hemorrhage control through direct pressure. She meticulously assesses the integrity of circulation by checking distal pulses. Wound care requires strict aseptic technique and confirming the patient’s Tetanus immunization status. For the severe metabolic emergency of hypoglycemia (e.g., blood glucose 36 mg/dL), the nurse must rapidly administer 50% dextrose intravenously. This swift action prevents severe neurological damage. Once conscious, the patient requires education on insulin use and adhering to meal schedules. 
Managing a patient experiencing a seizure involves immediate safety measures. The nurse clears the area of harmful objects, positions the patient on the side to prevent aspiration, and strictly avoids inserting anything into the mouth. Post-seizure, she assesses level of consciousness, vital signs, and neurological status. Anticonvulsant medication is administered as ordered, followed by postictal care. Education includes teaching seizure precautions and promoting medication adherence. For anaphylaxis, the nurse’s rapid assessment leads to immediate administration of intramuscular epinephrine. Continuous monitoring of perfusion and vital signs, along with preparation for additional doses, is crucial to prevent cardiovascular collapse. 
Normal
A patient presenting with diaphoresis and severe substernal chest pain (radiating to the jaw/arm) must be managed as a potential acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The nurse initiates continuous 5-lead cardiac monitoring (telemetry), secures 18g IV access, and ensures the defibrillator (with pads on) and crash cart are ready. ECG interpretation (e.g., ST-elevation / STEMI) is vital. When managing anaphylaxis (SpO_2 < 90%, stridor), the nurse assesses airway patency and rapidly administers epinephrine (1:1,000) 0.3mg IM (intramuscularly). IV fluids (0.9% NaCl) are initiated for hypoperfusion.
A patient collapsing requires immediate assessment for cardiac arrest (checking carotid pulse 10 sec). If absent, she initiates high-quality CPR (rate 100-120/min, depth 2-2.4 inches) per BLS/ACLS guidelines. The defibrillator is applied. After achieving Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC), the nurse secures the airway (ETT / LMA) and assists in post-resuscitation care (TTM). For a toddler who swallowed a caustic (e.g., detergent, lye), the nurse (wearing PPE) ensures airway patency and contacts Poison Control (1-800-222-1222). Activated charcoal is contraindicated for caustics but prepared for others (Tylenol OD).
When a VF/VT (Ventricular Fibrillation/Tachycardia) cardiac arrest occurs, the nurse performs high-quality CPR (compressions 30:2) per BLS/ACLS protocols. The application of the AED/defibrillator (200 Joules biphasic) is critical. Achieving Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) transitions into post-resuscitation monitoring (maintaining SBP 90 mmHg, SpO_2  94%). For a pediatric patient (10kg) who swallowed toxins (e.g., acetaminophen), the nurse contacts Poison Control and administers activated charcoal (e.g., 1g/kg) or the antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC).
Hard
Upon arrival of a polytrauma patient (e.g., MVC), the EN performs the TNCC (Trauma Nursing Core Course) primary survey: A (Airway/C-spine), B (Breathing - assessing for pneumothorax), C (Circulation - assessing for hemorrhage), D (Disability - GCS/pupils), E (Exposure/Environment). She immediately stabilizes the cervical spine (C-spine), starts two large-bore (14g/16g) IVs for fluid resuscitation (e.g., 1L 0.9% NaCl / LR), and administers O2 (15L via non-rebreather mask / NRB). She assists with Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) (e.g., preparing etomidate/succinylcholine) and prepares for Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP). For a STEMI, she obtains a 12-lead ECG (target: door-to-ECG < 10 min) and administers MONA (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin 324mg).
During the ATLS/TNCC trauma assessment (ABCDE), stabilization is vital. Establishing two large-bore (14g/16g) PIVs for hemorrhagic shock (SBP < 90 mmHg) resuscitation (e.g., crystalloids / PRBCs) and C-spine immobilization are paramount. The nurse assists with Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) (using EtCO2 for placement confirmation). If a patient presents with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) / STEMI, obtaining a 12-lead ECG (<10 min) and administering aspirin (ASA) 324mg PO are priority protocols (e.g., preparing for PCI / thrombolytics). Continuous ECG interpretation (e.g., for V-Fib / V-Tach) ensures readiness for defibrillation / cardioversion.
When managing an acute asthma exacerbation (e.g., status asthmaticus), the nurse assesses for tripod positioning, accessory muscle use, and inaudible wheezing. She initiates nebulized SABA (Short-Acting Beta-Agonist) therapy (e.g., Albuterol/Ipratropium "DuoNeb") and systemic corticosteroids (e.g., Solu-Medrol IVP). The nurse monitors SpO_2 (goal > 92%) and PEFR (Peak Expiratory Flow Rate), preparing for magnesium sulfate infusion or BiPAP. In a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI), the nurse uses the START system: Red (Immediate): compromised ABCs; Yellow (Delayed): serious, non-life-threatening; Green (Minor): "walking wounded"; Black (Expectant/Deceased).
Emergency triage during a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) demands the nurse utilize the START system (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment). This requires categorizing patients (e.g., RPM: Respirations >30 = Red; Perfusion/Cap Refill >2 sec = Red; Mental Status/Commands = Fails = Red). Black-tagged (Expectant) patients receive palliative care. For status asthmaticus (a severe exacerbation), the nurse assesses for pulsus paradoxus and a silent chest, positioning in high-Fowler's (or tripod) and initiating nebulized SABA (e.g., Albuterol) / anticholinergics (e.g., Ipratropium). She assesses wheezing (inspiratory/expiratory) and monitors PEFR (Peak Expiratory Flow Rate), preparing for IV magnesium sulfate or BIPAP.
